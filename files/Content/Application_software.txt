Application software - WikipediaApplication softwareFrom Wikipedia the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to search  GNU Image Manipulation Program GIMP version 26 a freely distributed applicationApplication software app for short is a program or group of programs designed for end users Examples of an application include a word processor a spreadsheet an accounting application a web browser an email client a media player a file viewer an aeronautical flight simulator a console game or a photo editor The collective noun application software refers to all applications collectively1 This contrasts with system software which is mainly involved with running the computerApplications may be bundled with the computer and its system software or published separately and may be coded as proprietary open-source or university projects2 Apps built for mobile platforms are called mobile appsContents1 Terminology11 Metonymy12 Apps and killer apps2 Classification21 By property and use

application software is a computer program designed to help people perform an activity An application thus differs from an operating system which runs a computer a utility which performs maintenance or general-purpose chores and a programming tool with which computer programs are createdoriginal research Depending on the activity for which it was designed an application can manipulate text numbers audio graphics and a combination of these elements Some application packages focus on a single task such as word processing others called integrated software include several applications3User-written software tailors systems to meet the users specific needs User-written software includes spreadsheet templates word processor macros scientific simulations audio graphics and animation scripts Even email filters are a kind of user software Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it isThe delineation between system software such as operating systems and application software is not exact however and is occasionally the object of controversy4  For example one of the key questions in the United States v Microsoft Corp antitrust trial was whether Microsofts Internet Explorer web browser was part of its Windows operating system or a separable piece of application software  As another example the GNULinux naming controversy is in part due to disagreement about the relationship between the Linux kernel and the operating systems built over this kernel In some types of embedded systems the application software and the operating system software may be indistinguishable to the user as in the case of software used to control a VCR DVD player or microwave oven The above definitions may exclude some applications that may exist on some computers in large organizations For an alternative definition of an app  see Application Portfolio ManagementMetonymyeditThe word application once used as an adjective is not restricted to the of or pertaining to application software meaning5 For example concepts such as application programming interface API application server application virtualization application lifecycle management and portable application apply to all computer programs alike not just application softwareApps and killer appseditMain article Killer applicationSome applications are available in versions for several different platforms others only work on one and are thus called for example a Geography application for Microsoft Windows or an Android application for education or a Linux game  Sometimes a new and popular application arises which only runs on one platform increasing the desirability of that platform  This is called a killer application or killer app For example VisiCalc was the first modern spreadsheet software for the Apple II and helped selling the then-new personal computers into offices For Blackberry it was their email softwareIn recent years the shortened term app coined in 1981 or earlier6 has become popular to refer to applications for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets the shortened form matching their typically smaller scope compared to applications on PCs Even more recently the shortened version is used for desktop application software as wellClassificationeditThere are many different and alternative ways in order to classify  application softwareBy the legal point of view application software is mainly classified with a black box approach in relation to the rights of its final end-users or subscribers with eventual intermediate and tiered subscription levelsSoftware applications are also classified in respect of the programming language in which the source code is written or executed and respect of their purpose and outputsBy property and use rightseditApplication software is usually distinguished among two main classes closed source vs open source software applications and among free or proprietary software applicationsProprietary software is placed under the exclusive copyright and a software license grants limited usage rights The open-closed principle states that software may be open only for extension but not for modification Such applications can only get add-on by third-partiesFree and open-source software shall be run distributed sold or extended for any purpose and -being open- shall be modified or reversed in the same wayFOSS software applications released under a free license may be perpetual and also royalty-free Perhaps the owner the holder or third-party enforcer of any right copyright trademark patent or ius in re aliena are entitled to add exceptions limitations time decays or expiring dates to the license terms of usePublic-domain software is a type of FOSS which is royalty-free and - openly or reservedly- can be run distributed modified reversed republished or created in derivative works without any copyright attribution and therefore revocation It can even be sold but without transferring the public domain property to other single subjects Public-domain SW can be released under an unlicensing legal statement which enforces those terms and conditions for an indefinite duration for a lifetime or foreverBy coding languageeditSince the development and near-universal adoption of the web an important distinction that has emerged has been between web applications  written with HTML JavaScript and other web-native technologies and typically requiring one to be online and running a web browser and the more traditional native applications written in whatever languages are available for ones particular type of computer There has been a contentious debate in the computing community regarding web applications replacing native applications for many purposes especially on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets Web apps have indeed greatly increased in popularity for some uses but the advantages of applications make them unlikely to disappear soon if ever Furthermore the two can be complementary and even integrated789By purpose and outputeditApplication software can also be seen as being either horizontal or vertical1011  Horizontal applications are more popular and widespread because they are general purpose for example word processors or databases Vertical applications are niche products designed for a particular type of industry or business or department within an organization Integrated suites of software will try to handle every specific aspect possible of for example manufacturing or banking worker or accounting or customer serviceThere are many types of application software12  LibreOffice Writer an open-source word processor that is a component of LibreOffice running on Linux MintAn application suite consists of multiple applications bundled together They usually have related functions features and user interfaces and may be able to interact with each other eg open each others files Business applications often come in suites eg Microsoft Office LibreOffice and iWork which bundle together a word processor a spreadsheet etc but suites exist for other purposes eg graphics or musicEnterprise software addresses the needs of an entire organizations processes and data flows across several departments often in a large distributed environment  Examples include enterprise resource planning systems customer relationship management CRM systems and supply chain management software Departmental Software is a sub-type of enterprise software with a focus on smaller organizations or groups within a large organization Examples include travel expense management and IT HelpdeskEnterprise infrastructure software provides common capabilities needed to support enterprise software systems  Examples include databases email servers and systems for managing networks and securityApplication platform as a service aPaaS is a cloud computing service that offers development and deployment environments for application servicesInformation worker software lets users create and manage information often for individual projects within a department in contrast to enterprise management Examples include time management resource management analytical collaborative and documentation tools Word processors spreadsheets email and blog clients personal information system and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasksContent access software is used primarily to access content without editing but may include software that allows for content editing Such software addresses the needs of individuals and groups to consume digital entertainment and published digital content Examples include media players web browsers and help browsersEducational software is related to content access software but has the content or features adapted for use in by educators or students For example it may deliver evaluations tests track progress through material or include collaborative capabilitiesSimulation software simulates physical or abstract systems for either research training or entertainment purposesMedia development software generates print and electronic media for others to consume most often in a commercial or educational setting This includes graphic-art software desktop publishing software multimedia development software HTML editors digital-animation editors digital audio and video composition and many others13Product engineering software is used in developing hardware and software products This includes computer-aided design CAD computer-aided engineering CAE computer language editing and compiling tools integrated development environments and application programmer interfacesEntertainment Software can refer to video games screen savers programs to display motion pictures or play recorded music and other forms of entertainment which can be experienced through use of a computing deviceApplications can also be classified by computing platform such as a particular operating system delivery network such as in cloud computing and Web 20 applications or delivery devices such as mobile apps for mobile devicesThe operating system itself can be considered application software when performing simple calculating measuring rendering and word processing tasks not used to control hardware via command-line interface or graphical user interface This does not include application software bundled within operating systems such as a software calculator or text editorInformation worker softwareeditAccounting softwareData
