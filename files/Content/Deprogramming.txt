Deprogramming - WikipediaDeprogrammingFrom Wikipedia the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchDeprogramming refers to measures that claim to assist1 a person who holds a controversial belief system in changing those beliefs and abandoning allegiance to the religious political economic or social group associated with the belief system23 The dictionary definition of deprogramming is to free or to retrain someone from specific beliefs4 Some controversial methods and practices of self-identified deprogrammers have involved kidnapping false imprisonment and coercion5 which have sometimes resulted in criminal convictions of the deprogrammers67 Some deprogramming regimens are designed for individuals taken against their will which has led to controversies over freedom of religion kidnapping and civil rights as well as the violence which is sometimes involved8Contents1 Background2 Procedures21 Violence3 Effectiveness and harm4 Government5 Controversy and related issues6 Referral and kickback system7 Victims8 Exit counseling9 In popular culture10 See also11 References12 External linksBackgroundeditAs a technique the deprogramming that has been practiced over the last half century has been typically commissioned by relatives often parents of adult offspring who objected to the subjects membership in an organization or group It has been compared to exorcisms in both methodology and manifestation9 and the process sometimes has been performed with tacit support of law enforcement and judicial officials1011  In response to a burgeoning number of new religious movements in the 1970s in the United States the father of deprogramming Ted Patrick introduced many of these techniques to a wider audience as a means to combat cults1213 Since then deprogrammings have been carried out by the thousands11 For example various atrocity stories served as justification for deprogramming of Unification Church members in the USA14As a technique for encouraging people to disassociate with groups with whom they have as consenting adults chosen to associate deprogramming is a controversial practice Even some cult critics have denounced it on legal and ethical grounds15 Similar actions when done without force have been referred to as exit counseling Sometimes the word deprogramming is used in a wider andor ironic or humorous sense to mean the freeing of someone often oneself from any previously uncritically assimilated idea According to Carol Giambalvo exit cousellors are usually former cult members themselves16Various academics have commented on the practice For example as defined by James T Richardson UNLV Professor of Sociology and Judicial Studies and Director of the Grant Sawyer Center for Justice Studies deprogramming is a private self-help process whereby participants in unpopular new religious movements NRMs were forcibly removed from the group incarcerated and put through radical resocialization processes that were supposed to result in their agreeing to leave the group17 Law professor Douglas Laycock author of Religious Liberty The free exercise clause wroteBeginning in the 1970s many parents responded to the initial conversion with deprogramming The essence of deprogramming was to physically abduct the convert isolate him and physically restrain him and barrage him with continuous arguments and attacks against his new religion threatening to hold him forever until he agreed to leave it18Lawyer John LeMoult writing in a law review journal described such practices as the person subject to deprogramming being seized held against his will subjected to mental emotional and even physical pressures until he renounces his beliefs and compared this power to that of Nazis over their prisoners19ProcedureseditThere has never been a standard procedure among deprogrammers descriptions in anecdotal reports studies and interviews with former deprogrammers vary greatly Deprogrammers generally operate on the presumption that the people they are paid to extract from religious organizations are victims of mind control or brainwashing Books written by deprogrammers and exit counselors say that the most essential part of freeing the mind of a person is to convince the subject that he or she had been under the mental control of otherscitation neededTed Patrick one of the pioneers of deprogramming used a confrontational method enlisting psychiatrists and psychologists to assist him in the deprogramming process19 Patrick was tried and convicted of multiple felonies related to kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment of deprogramming subjects20Sylvia Buford an associate of Ted Patrick who has assisted him on many deprogrammings described five stages of deprogramming21Discredit the figure of authority the cult leaderPresent contradictions ideology versus reality How can he preach love when he exploits people is an exampleThe breaking point When a subject begins to listen to the deprogrammer when reality begins to take precedence over ideologySelf-expression When the subject begins to open up and voice gripes against the cultIdentification and transference when the subject begins to identify with the deprogrammers starts to think as an opponent of the cult rather than as a memberViolenceeditThe deprogramming accounts vary widely regarding the use of force with the most dramatic accounts coming from deprogrammed people who returned to the groupSteven Hassan in his book Releasing the Bonds spoke against coercive deprogramming methods using force or threatsThe deprogramming case observed by Dubrow-Eichel did not include any violenceSociologist Eileen Barker wrote in Watching for ViolenceAlthough deprogramming has become less violent in the course of time  Numerous testimonies by those who were subjected to a deprogramming describe how they were threatened with a gun beaten denied sleep and food andor sexually assaulted But one does not have to rely on the victims for stories of violence Ted Patrick one of the most notorious deprogrammers used by CAGs who has spent several terms in prison for his exploits openly boasts about some of the violence he employed in November 1987 Cyril Vosper a Committee member of the British cult-awareness group FAIR was convicted in Munich of causing bodily harm in the course of one of his many deprogramming attempts and a number of similar convictions are on record for prominent members of CAGs elsewhere22In Colombrito vs Kelly the Court accepted the definition of deprogramming by J Le Moult published in 1978 in the Fordham Law ReviewDeprogrammers are people who at the request of a parent or other close relative will have a member of a religious sect seized then hold him against his will and subject him to mental emotional and even physical pressures until he renounces his religious beliefs Deprogrammers usually work for a fee which may easily run as high as 25000The deprogramming process begins with abduction Often strong men muscle the subject into a car and take him to a place where he is cut off from everyone but his captors He may be held against his will for upward of three weeks Frequently however the initial deprogramming only last a few days The subjects sleep is limited and he is told that he will not be released until his beliefs meet his captors approval Members of the deprogramming group as well as members of the family come into the room where the victim is held and barrage him with questions and denunciations until he recants his newly found religious beliefsDeprogrammer Carol Giambalvo writes in the 1998 text Deprogramming to Thought Reform ConsultationIt was believed that the hold of the brainwashing over the cognitive processes of a cult member needed to be broken  or snapped as some termed it  by means that would shock or frighten the cultist into thinking again For that reason in some cases cult leaders pictures were burned or there were highly confrontational interactions between deprogrammers and cultist What was often sought was an emotional response to the information the shock the fear and the confrontation There are horror stories  promoted most vehemently by the cults themselves  about restraint beatings and even rape And we have to admit that we have met former members who have related to us their deprogramming experience  several of handcuffs weapons wielded and sexual abuse But thankfully these are in the minority  and in our minds never justified Nevertheless deprogramming helped to free many individuals held captive to destructive cults at a time when other alternatives did not seem viable23Effectiveness and harmeditAlan W Gomes chairman of the department of theology at Talbot School of Theology Biola University in his 2009 book Unmasking the Cults reportsWhile advocates of the deprogramming position have claimed high rates of success studies show that natural attrition rates actually are higher than the success rate achieved through deprogramming24The Dialog Center International DCI a major Christian counter-cult organization founded in 1973 by a Danish professor of missiology and ecumenical theology Dr Johannes Aagaard25 rejects deprogramming believing that it is counterproductive ineffective and can harm the relationship between a cult member and concerned family members26Professor of psychiatry Saul Levine suggests that it is doubtful that deprogramming helps many people and goes on to say that it actually causes harm to the victim by very nature of the deprogramming For deprogramming to work the victim must be convinced that they joined a religious group against their will They then must renounce responsibility and accept that in some mysterious way that their minds were controlled27 It is Levines professional opinion that once deprogrammed a person would never be certain that they were really doing what they want He states that deprogramming destroys a persons identity and is likely to create permanent anxiety about freedom of choice and leave the deprogrammed subject dependent upon the guidance and advice of others Fundamentally deprogramming denies choice and creates dependency  It robs people of their sense of responsibility  Instead of encouraging people to accept that they made a mistake it encourages people to deny their actions and blame others2728GovernmenteditDeprogramming activities often fall outside of the law Government agencies have at times been aware and have taken part in deprogramming to enforce official views of correct beliefs and behaviors17  This can involve vigorous even violent efforts to dissuade people from participating in groups deemed unacceptable to the government and have been given legal sanction by the passage of laws that make illegal the activities or even the beliefsof the unpopular movement or group being targeted17Controversy and related issueseditSee also Mind control Deprogramming and the anti-cult movementIn the United States from the mid-1970s and throughout the 1980s mind control was a widely accepted theory in public opinion and the vast majority of newspaper and magazine accounts of deprogrammings assumed that recruits relatives were well justified to seek conservatorships and to hire deprogrammers It took nearly 20 years for public opinion to shift29One aspect that gradually became disturbing from a civil rights point of view was that relatives would use deception or other ethically questionable methodseven kidnappingto get the recruit into deprogrammers hands without allowing the person any recourse to a lawyer or psychiatrist of their own choosing Previously there would be a sanity hearing first and only then a commitment to an asylum or involuntary therapy But with deprogramming judges routinely granted parents legal authority over their adult children without a hearingOne of main objections raised to deprogramming as well as to exit counseling is the contention that they begin with a false premise Lawyers for some groups who have lost members due to deprogramming as well as some civil libertarians sociologists and psychologists argue that it is not the religious groups but rather the deprogrammers who are the ones who deceive and manipulate peopleDavid Bromley and Anson Shupe wroteDeprogrammers are like the American colonials who persecuted witches a confession drawn up before the suspect was brought in for torturing and based on the judges fantasies about witchcraft was signed under duress and then treated as justification for the torture30A number of factors contributed to the cessation of deprogrammingSome of the deprogrammed adults sued the deprogrammers or the relatives who had hired them  Also in 1987 psychologist Margaret Singer became unusable as an expert witness after the American Psychological Association APA rejected her Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control DIMPAC report31The American Civil Liberties Union published a statement in 1977 which saidACLU opposes the use of mental incompetency proceedings temporary conservatorship or denial of government protection as a method of depriving people of the free exercise of religion at least with respect to people who have reached the age of majority Mode of religious proselytizing or persuasion for a continued adherence that do not employ physical coercion or threat of same are protected by the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment against action of state laws or by state officials The claim of free exercise may not be overcome by the contention that brainwashing or mind control has been used in the absence of evidence that the above standards have been violatedIn the 1980s in the United States namely in New York Deprogramming Bill 1981 Kansas Deprogramming Bill 1982 and Nebraska conservatorship legislation for 1985 lawmakers unsuccessfully attempted to legalize involuntary deprogrammingRev Sun Myung Moon founder of the Unification Church many of whose members were targets of deprogramming issued this statement in 1983The methods involved in deprogramming are like those used in Communist concentration camps Using parents and relatives to entrap members deprogrammers commit grown adults to mental hospitals with the supposed illness of holding of a minority religious belief Other typical deprogramming techniques include kidnapping illegal detention violence psychological harassment sleep deprivation inducement to use alcohol and drugs sexual seduction and rape By such threats harassment and manipulation professional deprogrammers force members to renounce their faith Many people are injured physically and psychologically because of this criminal activity32In April 1993 Joe Szimhart and another defendant were acquitted by a jury in Boise Idaho Idaho vs Szimhart et al of all charges in the alleged kidnapdeprogramming attempt of a Church Universal and Triumphant member at the end of 199133During the 1990s deprogrammer Rick Ross was sued by Jason Scott a former member of a Pentecostal group called the Life Tabernacle Church after an unsuccessful deprogramming attempt In 1995 the jury awarded Scott 875000 in compensatory damages and 2500000 in punitive damages against Ross which were later settled for 5000 and 200 hours of services More significantly the jury also found that the leading anti-cult group known as the Cult Awareness Network was a co-conspirator in the crime and fined CAN 1000000 in punitive damages forcing the group into bankruptcy34 This case is often seen as effectively closing the door on the practice of involuntary deprogramming in the United States19Referral and kickback systemeditAnti-cult groups play a central role in maintaining the underground network of communications referrals transportation and housing necessary for continued deprogramming35Groups such as the Cult Awareness Network operated a referral scheme NARDEC in which they would refer people to deprogrammers in return for a kickback in the form of a donation or as a commission36 Deprogrammers such as Rick Ross Steven Hassan and Carol Giambalvo were amongst the CAN referred deprogrammers37VictimseditIn 1974 Kathy Crampton whose abduction and deprogramming were televised across the US went back to the Love Family group several days after her apparently successful deprogramming Patrick was charged with kidnapping but acquitted with the reasoning where parents are as here of the reasonable and intelligent belief that they were not physically capable of recapturing their daughter from existing imminent danger then the defense of necessity transfers or transposes to the constituted agent the person who acts upon their belief under such conditions Here that agent is the Defendant Ted Patrick District Court of the United States 1974 79 New York Times 1974In 1980 Susan Wirth a 35-year-old teacher living in San Francisco was abducted by her parents to be deprogrammed in reaction to her leftist political views and activities2938  Patrick was paid 27000 to carry out the deprogramming which involved handcuffing her to a bed for two weeks and denying her food39  She was later released and after returning to San Francisco spoke out against deprogramming but declined to press legal charges against her parents40In 1980 Patrick was convicted of conspiracy kidnapping and false imprisonment for abducting and attempting to deprogram Roberta McElfish a 26-year-old Tucson waitress7 Patrick was sentenced to one year in prison and fined 500041In 1981 Stephanie Riethmiller who lived in Ohio was kidnapped by deprogrammers hired by her parents to end her lesbian relationship She was held against her will and repeatedly raped After her release she filed civil charges against her parents and the deprogrammers which were dismissed in a trial that generated some controversy in the media294243In 1990 Patrick attempted to deprogram Elma Miller an Amish woman who had joined a liberal sect He was hired by her husband to return her to him and the Amish church Criminal charges of conspiracy were filed against Millers husband brother and two others but were later dropped on her request to the prosecuting attorney4445During the 1990s Rick Ross a noted cult intervention advocate who took part in a number of deprogramming sessions was sued by Jason Scott a former member of a Pentecostalist group called the Life Tabernacle Church part of United Pentecostal Church International after an unsuccessful coercive deprogramming46 The jury awarded Scott 875000 in compensatory damages and 1000000 in punitive damages against the Cult Awareness Network CAN and 2500000 against Ross later settled for 5000 and 200 hours of services as an expert consultant and intervention specialist46Exit counselingeditDeprogramming and exit counseling sometimes seen as one and the same are distinct approaches to convincing a person to leave a cult During exit counseling a subject has the ability to leave at any time and so the exit counselor focuses on building rapport rather than persuading the subject that the cult is a negative influence47Because deprogramming entails coercion and confinement costs typically rise to 10000 or more mainly due to the expense of a security team Exit counseling by contrast typically costs 2000 to 4000 for a three- to five-day intervention although cases requiring extensive research of little-known groups can cost much more estimated in 1993 Deprogramming especially when it fails also entails considerable legal and psychological risk for example a permanent alienation of the subject from his or her family The psychological and legal risks in exit counseling are significantly reduced Although deprogrammers do prepare families for the process exit counselors tend to work with them directly expecting those requesting the intervention to contribute more to the process that is exit counseling requires that families establish a reasonable and respectful level of communication with their loved one before the program itself can begin Because deprogramming relies on coercion which is illegal except in the case of conservatorship and is generally viewed as unethical deprogrammers critiques of the unethical practices of cults tend to be less credibility to the subject than the arguments of exit counselors48Steven Hassan author of the book Combatting Cult Mind Control states that he took part in a number of deprogrammings in the late 1970s and has spoken out against them since 198049 Hassan states that he has not participated in any deprogrammings since then although on page 114 of Combatting Hassan states that deprogrammings should be kept as a last resort if all other attempts fail to transform the individual Hassan is one of the major proponents of exit counseling as a form of intercession and he refers to his method as strategic intervention therapyIn popular cultureeditFaults a 2014 drama movie about deprogrammingHoly Smoke a 1999 movie based on the book with the same nameSplit Image a 1982 movie about
