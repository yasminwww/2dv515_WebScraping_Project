designed to communicate instructions to a machine  The source code for a simple computer program written in the C programming language When compiled and run it will give the output Hello worldA programming language is a formal language which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithmsMost programming languages consist of instructions for computers There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions rather than general programming languages Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad during the Islamic Golden Age1 Since the early 1800s programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms music boxes and player pianos2 The programs for these machines such as a player pianos scrolls did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditionsThousands of different programming languages have been created and more are being created every year Many programming languages are written in an imperative form ie as a sequence of operations to perform while other languages use the declarative form ie the desired result is specified not how to achieve itThe description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax form and semantics meaning Some languages are defined by a specification document for example the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard while other languages such as Perl have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference Some languages have both with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being commonContents1 Definitions2 History21 Early developments22 Refinement23 Consolidation and growth3 Elements31 Syntax32 Semantics321 Static

External linksDefinitionseditA programming language is a notation for writing programs which are specifications of a computation or algorithm3 Some authors restrict the term programming language to those languages that can express all possible algorithms34 Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language includeFunction and targetA computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs which involves a computer performing some kind of computation5 or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers disk drives robots6 and so on For example PostScript programs are frequently created by another program to control a computer printer or display More generally a programming language may describe computation on some possibly abstract machine It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a description possibly idealized of a machine or processor for that language7 In most practical contexts a programming language involves a computer consequently programming languages are usually defined and studied this way8 Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machinesAbstractionsProgramming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle9 This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions10Expressive powerThe theory of computation classifies languages by the computations they are capable of expressing All Turing complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms ANSIISO SQL-92 and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete yet often called programming languages1112Markup languages like XML HTML or troff which define structured data are not usually considered programming languages131415 Programming languages may however share the syntax with markup languages if a computational semantics is defined XSLT for example is a Turing complete language entirely using XML syntax161718 Moreover LaTeX which is mostly used for structuring documents also contains a Turing complete subset1920The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language21 However the usage of both terms varies among authors including the exact scope of each One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages22 Similarly languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages For instance markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming23Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers which have finite hardware resources24 John C Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats25HistoryeditMain article History of programming languagesEarly developmentseditVery early computers such as Colossus were programmed without the help of a stored program by modifying their circuitry or setting banks of physical controlsSlightly later programs could be written in machine language where the programmer writes each instruction in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly For example the instruction to add the value in two memory location might consist of 3 numbers an opcode that selects the add operation and two memory locations The programs in decimal or binary form were read in from punched cards paper tape magnetic tape or toggled in on switches on the front panel of the computer  Machine languages were later termed first-generation programming languages 1GLThe next step was development of so-called second-generation programming languages 2GL or assembly languages which were still closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the specific computer These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculationsThe first high-level programming languages or third-generation programming languages 3GL were written in the 1950s An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalkl developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945 However it was not implemented until 1998 and 200026John Mauchlys Short Code proposed in 1949 was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer27 Unlike machine code Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form However the program had to be translated into machine code every time it ran making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine codeAt the University of Manchester Alick Glennie developed Autocode in the early 1950s As a programming language it used a compiler to automatically convert the language into machine code The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first compiled high-level programming language2829The second autocode was developed for the Mark 1 by R A Brooker in 1954 and was called the Mark 1 Autocode Brooker also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by D F Hartley of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961 Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time A contemporary but separate thread of development Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machineIn 1954 FORTRAN was invented at IBM by John Backus It was the first widely used high-level general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation as opposed to just a design on paper3031 It is still a popular language for high-performance computing32 and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the worlds fastest supercomputers33Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US called FLOW-MATIC It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959 Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation and in early 1955 she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and implemented a prototype34 The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 195935 FLOW-MATIC was a major influence in the design of COBOL since only it and its direct descendant AIMACO were in actual use at the time36RefinementeditThe increased use of high-level languages introduced a requirement for low-level programming languages or system programming languages These languages to varying degrees provide facilities between assembly languages and high-level languages They can be used to perform tasks which require direct access to hardware facilities but still provide higher-level control structures and error-checkingThe period from the 1960s to the late 1970s brought the development of the major language paradigms now in useAPL introduced array programming and influenced functional programming37ALGOL refined both structured procedural programming and the discipline of language specification the Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 became a model for how later language specifications were writtenLisp implemented in 1958 was the first dynamically typed functional programming languageIn the 1960s Simula was the first language designed to support object-oriented programming in the mid-1970s Smalltalk followed with the first purely object-oriented languageC was developed between 1969 and 1973 as a system programming language for the Unix operating system and remains popular38Prolog designed in 1972 was the first logic programming languageIn 1978 ML built a polymorphic type system on top of Lisp pioneering statically typed functional programming languagesEach of these languages spawned descendants and most modern programming languages count at least one of them in their ancestryThe 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of structured programming and whether programming languages should be designed to support it39 Edsger Dijkstra in a famous 1968 letter published in the Communications of the ACM argued that GOTO statements should be eliminated from all higher level programming languages40Consolidation and growthedit  A selection of textbooks that teach programming in languages both popular and obscure These are only a few of the thousands of programming languages and dialects that have been designed in historyThe 1980s were years of relative consolidation C combined object-oriented and systems programming The United States government standardized Ada a systems programming language derived from Pascal and intended for use by defense contractors In Japan and elsewhere vast sums were spent investigating so-called fifth-generation languages that incorporated logic programming constructs41 The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp Rather than inventing new paradigms all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decadesOne important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of modules or large-scale organizational units of code Modula-2 Ada and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s which were often wedded to generic programming constructs42The rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages Perl originally a Unix scripting tool first released in 1987 became common in dynamic websites Java came to be used for server-side programming and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of Write once run anywhere UCSD Pascal had been popular for a time in the early 1980s These developments were not fundamentally novel rather they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms although their syntax was often based on the C family of programming languagesProgramming language evolution continues in both industry and research Current directions include security and reliability verification new kinds of modularity mixins delegates aspects and database integration such as Microsofts LINQFourth-generation programming languages 4GL are computer programming languages which aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than 3GLs Fifth-generation programming languages 5GL are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program rather than using an algorithm written by a programmerElementseditAll programming languages have some primitive building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectivelySyntaxeditMain article Syntax programming languages  Parse tree of Python code with inset tokenization  Syntax highlighting is often used to aid programmers in recognizing elements of source code The language above is PythonA programming languages surface form is known as its syntax Most programming languages are purely textual they use sequences of text including words numbers and punctuation much like written natural languages On the other hand there are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature using visual relationships between symbols to specify a programThe syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics either formal or hard-coded in a reference implementation Since most languages are textual this article discusses textual syntaxProgramming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions for lexical structure and BackusNaur form for grammatical structure Below is a simple grammar based on Lispexpression  atom  listatom        number  symbolnumber      -0-9symbol      A-Za-zlist         expression This grammar specifies the followingan expression is either an atom or a listan atom is either a number or a symbola number is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits optionally preceded by a plus or minus signa symbol is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters excluding whitespace anda list is a matched pair of parentheses with zero or more expressions inside itThe following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar 12345  and a b c232 1Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed per the languages rules and may depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation result in an error on translation or execution In some cases such programs may exhibit undefined behavior Even when a program is well-defined within a language it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote itUsing natural language as an example it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be falseColorless green ideas sleep furiously is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaningJohn is a married bachelor is grammatically well-formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be trueThe following C language fragment is syntactically correct but performs operations that are not semantically defined the operation p  4 has no meaning for a value having a complex type and p-im is not defined because the value of p is the null pointercomplex p  NULLcomplex absp  sqrtp  4  p-imIf the type declaration on the first line were omitted the program would trigger an error on undefined variable p during compilation However the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic informationThe grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the Chomsky hierarchy The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar ie they are context-free grammars43 Some languages including Perl and Lisp contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an undecidable problem and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution44 In contrast to Lisps macro system and Perls BEGIN blocks which may contain general computations C macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution45SemanticseditThe term semantics refers to the meaning of languages as opposed to their form syntaxStatic semanticseditThe static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms3 For compiled languages static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time Examples include checking that every identifier is declared before it is used in languages that require such declarations or that the labels on the arms of a case statement are distinct46 Many important restrictions of this type like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context eg not adding an integer to a function name or that subroutine calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments can be enforced by defining them as rules in a logic called a type system Other forms of static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part of static semantics Newer programming languages like Java and C have definite assignment analysis a form of data flow analysis as part of their static semanticsDynamic semanticseditMain article Semantics of programming languagesOnce data has been specified the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data For example the semantics may define the strategy by which expressions are evaluated to values or the manner in which control structures conditionally execute statements The dynamic semantics also known as execution semantics of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior There are many ways of defining execution semantics Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice A significant amount of academic research went into formal semantics of programming languages which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academiaType systemeditMain articles Data type Type system and Type safetyA type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types how it can manipulate those types and how they interact The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations Any decidable type system involves a trade-off while it rejects many incorrect programs it can also prohibit some correct albeit unusual programs In order to bypass this downside a number of languages have type loopholes usually unchecked casts that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types In most typed languages the type system is used only to type check programs but a number of languages usually functional ones infer types relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations The formal design and study of type systems is known as type theoryTyped versus untyped languageseditA language is typed if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable47 For example the data represented by this text between the quotes is a string and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled static type checking and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message or it may be detected while the program is running dynamic type checking resulting in a run-time exception Many languages allow a function called an exception handler to handle this exception and for example always return -1 as the resultA special case of typed languages are the single-typed languages These are often scripting or markup languages such as REXX or SGML and have only one data typedubious   discussmost commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric dataIn contrast an untyped language such as most assembly languages allows any operation to be performed on any data generally sequences of bits of various lengths47 High-level untyped languages include BCPL Tcl and some varieties of ForthIn practice while few languages are considered typed from the type theory verifying or rejecting all operations most modern languages offer a degree of typing47 Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system trading type-safety for finer control over the programs execution see castingStatic versus dynamic typingeditIn static typing all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed typically at compile-time For example 1 and 22 are integer expressions they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates47Statically typed languages can be either manifestly typed or type-inferred In the first case the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions for example at variable declarations In the second case the compiler infers the types of expressions and declarations based on context Most mainstream statically typed languages such as C C and Java are manifestly typed Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages such as Haskell and ML However many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference for example C Java and C all infer types in certain limited cases48 Additionally some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types for example an int can be used where the program expects a floatDynamic typing also called latent typing determines the type-safety of operations at run time in other words types are associated with run-time values rather than textual expressions47 As with type-inferred languages dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions Among other things this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution However type errors cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed potentially making debugging more difficult Lisp Smalltalk Perl Python JavaScript and Ruby are all examples of dynamically typed languagesWeak and strong typingeditWeak typing allows a value of one type to be treated as another for example treating a string as a number47 This can occasionally be useful but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at compile time and even at run timeStrong typing prevents these program faults An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error47 Strongly typed languages are often termed type-safe or safeAn alternative definition for weakly typed refers to languages such as Perl and JavaScript which permit a large number of implicit type conversions In JavaScript for example the expression 2  x implicitly converts x to a number and this conversion succeeds even if x is null undefined an Array or a string of letters Such implicit conversions are often useful but they can mask programming errorsStrong and static are now generally considered orthogonal concepts but usage in the literature differs Some use the term strongly typed to mean strongly statically typed or even more confusingly to mean simply statically typed Thus C has been called both strongly typed and weakly statically typed4950It may seem odd to some professional programmers that C could be weakly statically typed However notice that the use of the generic pointer the void pointer does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in C without using an explicit cast such as int or charStandard library and run-time systemeditMain article Standard libraryMost programming languages have an associated core library sometimes known as the standard library especially if it is included as part of the published language standard which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms data structures and mechanisms for input and outputThe line between a language and its core library differs from language to language In some cases the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language However a languages core library is often treated as part of the language by its users and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations Indeed some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library For example in Java a string literal is defined as an instance of the javalangString class similarly in Smalltalk an anonymous function expression a block constructs an instance of the librarys BlockContext class Conversely Scheme contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs and which must be implemented as parts of a libraryDesign and implementationeditProgramming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication having a syntactic form separate from its semantics and showing language families of related languages branching one from another5152 But as artificial constructs they also differ in fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage A significant difference is that a programming language can be fully described and studied in its entirety since it has a precise and finite definition53 By contrast natural languages have changing meanings given by their users in different communities While constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language hasMany programming languages have been designed from scratch altered to meet new needs and combined with other languages Many have eventually fallen into disuse Although there have been attempts to design one universal programming language that serves all purposes all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role54 The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are usedPrograms range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of programmersProgrammers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexityPrograms must balance speed size and simplicity on systems ranging from microcontrollers to supercomputersPrograms may be written once and not change for generations or they may undergo continual modificationProgrammers may simply differ in their tastes they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular languageOne common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of abstraction The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer As new programming languages have developed features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer This lets them write more functionality per time unit55Natural language programming has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming However this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate Edsger W Dijkstra took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs and dismissed natural language programming as foolish56 Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea57 Hybrid approaches have been taken in Structured English and SQLA languages designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of programming The most important of these artifacts are the language specification and implementationSpecificationeditMain article Programming language specificationThe specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language and if so what its behavior shall beA programming language specification can take several forms including the followingAn explicit definition of the syntax static semantics and execution semantics of the language While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar semantic definitions may be written in natural language eg as in the C language or a formal semantics eg as in Standard ML58 and Scheme59 specificationsA description of the behavior of a translator for the language eg the C and Fortran specifications The syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description which may be written in natural or a formal languageA reference or model implementation sometimes written in the language being specified eg Prolog or ANSI REXX60 The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementationImplementationeditMain article Programming language implementationAn implementation of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software There are broadly two approaches to programming language implementation compilation and interpretation It is generally possible to implement a language using either techniqueThe output of a compiler may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting For instance some implementations of BASIC compile and then execute the source a line at a timePrograms that are executed directly on the hardware usually run much faster than those that are interpreted in software61bettersourceneededOne technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is just-in-time compilation Here the virtual machine just before execution translates the blocks of bytecode which are going to be used to machine code for direct execution on the hardwareProprietary languageseditThis section does not cite any sources Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources Unsourced material may

programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property Proprietary programming languages are commonly domain specific languages or internal scripting languages for a single product some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor while others are available to external usersSome programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open for example Oracle Corporation asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the Java programming language62 and Microsofts C programming language which has open implementations of most parts of the system also has Common Language Runtime CLR as a closed environment63Many proprietary languages are widely used in spite of their proprietary nature examples include MATLAB VBScript and Wolfram Language  Some languages may make the transition from closed to open for example Erlang was originally an Ericssons internal programming language64UseeditThousands of different programming languages have been created mainly in the computing field65Software is commonly built with 5 programming languages or more66Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness When using a natural language to communicate with other people human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors and still expect their intent to be understood However figuratively speaking computers do exactly what they are told to do and cannot understand what code the programmer intended to write The combination of the language definition a program and the programs inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed within the domain of control of that program On the other hand ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming languageA programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data A programmer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available called primitives67 Programming is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environmentPrograms for a computer might be executed in a batch process without human interaction or a user might type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter In this case the commands are simply programs whose execution is chained together When a language can run its commands through an interpreter such as a Unix shell or other command-line interface without compiling it is called a scripting language68Measuring language usageeditMain article Measuring programming language popularityDetermining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours a different one has more lines of code and a third may consume the most CPU time Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications For example COBOL is still strong in the corporate data center often on large mainframes6970 Fortran in scientific and engineering applications Ada in aerospace transportation military real-time and embedded applications and C in embedded applications and operating systems Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applicationsVarious methods of measuring language popularity each subject to a different bias over what is measured have been proposedcounting the number of job advertisements that mention the language71the number of books sold that teach or describe the language72estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language  which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches73counts of language references ie to the name of the language found using a web search engineCombining and averaging information from various internet sites stackifycom reported the ten most popular programming languages as in descending order by overall popularity Java C C Python C JavaScript VB NET R PHP and MATLAB74Dialects flavors and implementationseditA dialect of a programming language or a data exchange language is a relatively small variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature With languages such as Scheme and Forth standards may be considered insufficient inadequate or illegitimate by implementors so often they will deviate from the standard making a new dialect In other cases a dialect is created for use in a domain-specific language often a subset In the Lisp world most languages that use basic S-expression syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects although they vary wildly as do say Racket and Clojure As it is common for one language to have several dialects it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation The BASIC programming language has many dialectsThe explosion of Forth dialects led to the saying If youve seen one Forth youve seen one ForthTaxonomieseditFurther information Categorical list of programming languagesThere is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different familyThe task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes For example Java is both an object-oriented language because it encourages object-oriented organization and a concurrent language because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple threads in parallel Python is an object-oriented scripting languageIn broad strokes programming languages divide into programming paradigms and a classification by intended domain of use with general-purpose programming languages distinguished from domain-specific programming languages Traditionally programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences ie issuing commands These are generally called imperative programming languages A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer which is the main feature of declarative programming75 More refined paradigms include procedural programming object-oriented programming functional programming and logic programming some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic An assembly language is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture By purpose programming languages might be considered general purpose system programming languages scripting languages domain-specific languages or concurrentdistributed languages or a combination of these76 Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals77A programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm For instance most programming languages use English language keywords while a minority do not Other languages may be classified as being deliberately esoteric or notSee alsoeditComputer programming portalComparison of programming languages basic instructionsComparison of programming

the study of the theory of programming this text will generally limit itself to the study of programs as they are executed on a computer David A Schmidt The structure of typed programming languages

registerswhich can assume only finitely many valuesor statesand these states are not further distinguished in terms of any other attributes authors footnote This may sound like a truism but its implications are far reaching For example it would imply that any model for programming languages by fixing certain of its parameters or features should be reducible in a natural way to a model for
