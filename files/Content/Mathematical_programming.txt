set of available alternatives1 Optimization problems of sorts arise in all quantitative disciplines from computer science and engineering to operations research and economics and the development of solution methods has been of interest in mathematics for centuries2In the simplest case an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of applied mathematics More generally optimization includes finding best available values of some objective function given a defined domain or input including a variety of different types of objective functions and different types of domainsContents1 Optimization problems2 Notation21 Minimum and maximum value of a function22 Optimal input arguments3 History4 Major subfields41 Multi-objective optimization42

refer to the technique as energy minimization speaking of the value of the function f as representing the energy of the system being modeled In Machine Learning it is always necessary to continuously evaluate the quality of a data model by using a cost function where a minimum implies a set of possibly optimal parameters with an optimal lowest errorTypically A is some subset of the Euclidean space n often specified by a set of constraints equalities or inequalities that the members of A have to satisfy  The domain A of f is called the search space or the choice set while the elements of A are called candidate solutions or feasible solutionsThe function f is called variously an objective function a loss function or cost function minimization3  a utility function or fitness function maximization or in certain fields an energy function or energy functional A feasible solution that minimizes or maximizes if that is the goal the objective function is called an optimal solutionIn mathematics conventional optimization problems are usually stated in terms of minimizationA local minimum x is defined as an element for which there exists some   0 such that

maxima are defined similarlyWhile a local minimum is at least as good as any nearby elements a global minimum is at least as good as every feasible elementGenerally unless the objective function is convex in a minimization problem there may be several local minimaIn a convex problem if there is a local minimum that is interior not on the edge of the set of feasible elements it is also the global minimum but a nonconvex problem may have more than one local minimum not all of which need be global minimaA large number of algorithms proposed for solving the nonconvex problems  including the majority of commercially available solvers  are  not capable of making a distinction between locally optimal solutions and globally optimal solutions and will treat the former as actual solutions to the original problem Global optimization is the branch of applied mathematics and numerical analysis that is concerned with the development of deterministic algorithms that are capable of guaranteeing

optimumThe term linear programming for certain optimization cases was due to GeorgeB Dantzig although much of the theory had been introduced by Leonid Kantorovich in 1939 Programming in this context does not refer to computer programming but comes from the use of program by the United States military to refer to proposed training and logistics schedules which were the problems Dantzig studied at that time Dantzig published the Simplex algorithm in 1947 and John von Neumann developed the theory of duality in the same yearOther notable researchers in mathematical optimization include the

Tyrrell RockafellarNaum Z ShorAlbert TuckerMajor subfieldseditConvex programming studies the case when the objective function is convex minimization or concave maximization and the constraint set is convex This can be viewed as a particular case of nonlinear programming or as generalization of linear or convex quadratic programmingLinear programming LP a type of convex programming studies the case in which the objective function f is linear and the constraints are specified using only linear equalities and inequalities Such a constraint set is called a polyhedron or a polytope if it is boundedSecond order cone programming SOCP is a convex program and includes certain types of quadratic programsSemidefinite programming SDP is a subfield of convex optimization where the underlying variables are semidefinite matrices It is a generalization of linear and convex quadratic programmingConic programming is a general form of convex programming  LP SOCP and SDP can all be viewed as conic programs with the appropriate type of coneGeometric programming is a technique whereby objective and inequality constraints expressed as posynomials and equality constraints as monomials can be transformed into a convex programInteger programming studies linear programs in which some or all variables are constrained to take on integer values  This is not convex and in general much more difficult than regular linear programmingQuadratic programming allows the objective function to have quadratic terms while the feasible set must be specified with linear equalities and inequalities  For specific forms of the quadratic term this is a type of convex programmingFractional programming studies optimization of ratios of two nonlinear functions The special class of concave fractional programs can be transformed to a convex optimization problemNonlinear programming studies the general case in which the objective function or the constraints or both contain nonlinear parts  This may or may not be a convex program In general whether the program is convex affects the difficulty of solving itStochastic programming studies the case in which some of the constraints or parameters depend on random variablesRobust programming is like stochastic programming an attempt to capture uncertainty in the data underlying the optimization problem Robust optimization aims to find solutions that are valid under all possible realizations of the uncertaintiesCombinatorial optimization is concerned with problems where the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to a discrete oneStochastic optimization is used with random noisy function measurements or random inputs in the search processInfinite-dimensional optimization studies the case when the set of feasible solutions is a subset of an infinite-dimensional space such as a space of functionsHeuristics and metaheuristics make few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized Usually heuristics do not guarantee that any optimal solution need be found On the other hand heuristics are used to find approximate solutions for many complicated optimization problemsConstraint satisfaction studies the case in which the objective function f is constant this is used in artificial intelligence particularly in automated reasoningConstraint programming is a programming paradigm wherein relations between variables are stated in the form of constraintsDisjunctive programming is used where at least one constraint must be satisfied but not all It is of particular use in schedulingSpace mapping is a concept for modeling and optimization of an engineering system to high-fidelity fine model accuracy exploiting a suitable physically meaningful coarse or surrogate modelIn a number of subfields the techniques are designed primarily for optimization in dynamic contexts that is decision making over timeCalculus of variations seeks to optimize an action integral over some space to an extremum by varying a function of the coordinatesOptimal control theory is a generalization of the calculus of variations which introduces control policiesDynamic programming is the approach to solve the stochastic optimization problem with stochastic randomness and unknown model parameters It studies the case in which the optimization strategy is based on splitting the problem into smaller subproblems The equation that describes the relationship between these subproblems is called the Bellman equationMathematical programming with equilibrium constraints is where the constraints include variational inequalities or  complementaritiesMulti-objective optimizationeditMain article Multi-objective optimizationAdding more than one objective to an optimization problem adds complexity For example to optimize a structural design one would desire a design that is both light and rigid When two objectives conflict a trade-off must be created There may be one lightest design one stiffest design and an infinite number of designs that are some compromise of weight and rigidity The set of trade-off designs that improve upon one criterion at the expense of another is known as the Pareto set The curve created plotting weight against stiffness of the best designs is known as the Pareto frontierA design is judged to be Pareto optimal equivalently Pareto efficient or in the Pareto set if it is not dominated by any other design If it is worse than another design in some respects and no better in any respect then it is dominated and is not Pareto optimalThe choice among Pareto optimal solutions to determine the favorite solution is delegated to the decision maker In other words defining the problem as multi-objective optimization signals that some information is missing desirable objectives are given but combinations of them are not rated relative to each other In some cases the missing information can be derived by interactive sessions with the decision makerMulti-objective optimization problems have been generalized further into vector optimization problems where the partial ordering is no longer given by the Pareto orderingMulti-modal or global optimizationeditOptimization problems are often multi-modal that is they possess multiple good solutions They could all be globally good same cost function value or there could be a mix of globally good and locally good solutions Obtaining all or at least some of the multiple solutions is the goal of a multi-modal optimizerClassical optimization techniques due to their iterative approach do not perform satisfactorily when they are used to obtain multiple solutions since it is not guaranteed that different solutions will be obtained even with different starting points in multiple runs of the algorithm Common approaches to global optimization problems where multiple local extrema may be present include evolutionary algorithms Bayesian optimization and simulated annealingClassification of critical points and extremaeditFeasibility problemeditThe satisfiability problem also called the feasibility problem is just the problem of finding any feasible solution at all without regard to objective value This can be regarded as the special case of mathematical optimization where the objective value is the same for every solution and thus any solution is optimalMany optimization algorithms need to start from a feasible point One way to obtain such a point is to relax the feasibility conditions using a slack variable with enough slack any starting point is feasible Then minimize that slack variable until slack is null or negativeExistenceeditThe extreme value theorem of Karl Weierstrass states that a continuous real-valued function on a compact set attains its maximum and minimum value More generally a lower semi-continuous function on a compact set attains its minimum an upper semi-continuous function on a compact set attains its maximum point or viewNecessary conditions for optimalityeditOne of Fermats theorems states that optima of unconstrained problems are found at stationary points where the first derivative or the gradient of the objective function is zero see first derivative test More generally they may be found at critical points where the first derivative or gradient of the objective function is zero or is undefined or on the boundary of the choice set An equation or set of equations stating that the first derivatives equals zero at an interior optimum is called a first-order condition or a set of first-order conditionsOptima of equality-constrained problems can be found by the Lagrange multiplier method The optima of problems with equality andor inequality constraints can be found using the KarushKuhnTucker conditionsSufficient conditions for optimalityeditWhile the first derivative test identifies points that might be extrema this test does not distinguish a point that is a minimum from one that is a maximum or one that is neither When the objective function is twice differentiable these cases can be distinguished by checking the second derivative or the matrix of second derivatives called the Hessian matrix in unconstrained problems or the matrix of second derivatives of the objective function and the constraints called the bordered Hessian in constrained problems The conditions that distinguish maxima or minima from other stationary points are called second-order conditions see Second derivative test If a candidate solution satisfies the first-order conditions then satisfaction of the second-order conditions as well is sufficient to establish at least local optimalitySensitivity and continuity of optimaeditThe envelope theorem describes how the value of an optimal solution changes when an underlying parameter changes The process of computing this change is called comparative staticsThe maximum theorem of Claude Berge 1963 describes the continuity of an optimal solution as a function of underlying parametersCalculus of optimizationeditMain article KarushKuhnTucker conditionsSee also Critical point mathematics Differential calculus Gradient Hessian matrix Positive definite matrix Lipschitz continuity Rademachers theorem Convex function and Convex analysisFor unconstrained problems with twice-differentiable functions some critical points can be found by finding the points where the gradient of the objective function is zero that is the stationary points More generally a zero subgradient certifies that a local minimum has been found for minimization problems with convex functions and other locally Lipschitz functionsFurther critical points can be classified  using the definiteness of the Hessian matrix If the Hessian is positive definite at a critical point then the point is a local minimum if the Hessian matrix is negative definite then the point is a local maximum finally if indefinite then the point is some kind of saddle pointConstrained problems can often be transformed into unconstrained problems with the help of Lagrange multipliers Lagrangian relaxation can also provide approximate solutions to difficult constrained problemsWhen the objective function is a convex function then any local minimum will also be a global minimum There exist efficient numerical techniques for minimizing convex functions such as interior-point methodsComputational optimization techniqueseditTo solve problems researchers may use algorithms that terminate in a finite number of steps or iterative methods that converge to a solution on some specified class of problems or heuristics that may provide approximate solutions

optimizationCombinatorial algorithmsQuantum optimization algorithmsIterative methodseditMain article Iterative methodSee also Newtons method in optimization Quasi-Newton method Finite difference Approximation theory and Numerical analysisThe iterative methods used to solve problems of nonlinear programming differ according to whether they evaluate Hessians gradients or only function values While evaluating Hessians H and gradients G improves the rate of convergence for functions for which these quantities exist and vary sufficiently smoothly such evaluations increase the computational complexity or computational cost of each iteration In some cases the computational complexity may be excessively highOne major criterion for optimizers is just the number of required function evaluations as this often is already a large computational effort usually much more effort than within the optimizer itself which mainly has to operate over the N variablesThe derivatives provide detailed information for such optimizers but are even harder to calculate eg approximating the gradient takes at least N1 function evaluations For approximations of the 2nd derivatives collected in the Hessian matrix the number of function evaluations is in the order of N Newtons method requires the 2nd order derivatives so for each iteration the number of function calls is in the order of N but for a simpler pure gradient optimizer it is only N However gradient optimizers need usually more iterations than Newtons algorithm Which one is best with respect to the number of function calls

gradients can be approximated using finite differences in which case a gradient-based method can be usedInterpolation methodsPattern search methods which have better convergence properties than the NelderMead heuristic with simplices which is listed belowGlobal convergenceeditMore generally if the objective function is not a quadratic function then many optimization methods use other methods to ensure that some subsequence of iterations converges to an optimal solution The first and still popular method for ensuring convergence relies on line searches which optimize a function along one dimension A second and increasingly popular method for ensuring convergence uses trust regions Both line searches and trust regions are used in modern methods of non-differentiable optimization Usually a global optimizer is much slower than advanced local optimizers such as BFGS so often an efficient global optimizer can be constructed by starting the local optimizer from different starting pointsHeuristicseditMain article Heuristic algorithmBesides finitely terminating algorithms and convergent iterative methods there are heuristics A heuristic is any algorithm which is not guaranteed mathematically to find the solution but which is nevertheless useful in certain practical situations List of some well-known heuristicsMemetic algorithmDifferential evolutionEvolutionary

LIONsolverApplicationseditMechanicseditProblems in rigid body dynamics in particular articulated rigid body dynamics often require mathematical programming techniques since you can view rigid body dynamics as attempting to solve an ordinary differential equation on a constraint manifold5 the constraints are various nonlinear geometric constraints such as these two points must always coincide this surface must not penetrate any other or this point must always lie somewhere on this curve Also the problem of computing contact forces can be done by solving a linear complementarity problem which can also be viewed as a QP quadratic programming problemMany design problems can also be expressed as optimization programs This application is called design optimization One subset is the engineering optimization and another recent and growing subset of this field is multidisciplinary design optimization which while useful in many problems has in particular been applied to aerospace engineering problemsThis approach may be applied in cosmology and astrophysics6Economics and financeeditEconomics is closely enough linked to optimization of agents that an influential definition relatedly describes economics qua science as the study of human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means with alternative uses7  Modern optimization theory includes traditional optimization theory but also overlaps with game theory and the study of economic equilibria The Journal of Economic Literature codes classify mathematical programming optimization techniques and related topics under JELC61-C63In microeconomics the utility maximization problem and its dual problem the expenditure minimization problem are economic optimization problems Insofar as they behave consistently consumers are assumed to maximize their utility while firms are usually assumed to maximize their profit Also agents are often modeled as being risk-averse thereby preferring to avoid risk Asset prices are also modeled using optimization theory though the underlying mathematics relies on optimizing stochastic processes rather than on static optimization International trade theory also uses optimization to explain trade patterns between nations The optimization of portfolios is an example of multi-objective optimization in economicsSince the 1970s economists have modeled dynamic decisions over time using control theory8 For example dynamic search models are used to study labor-market behavior9 A crucial distinction is between deterministic and stochastic models10  Macroeconomists build dynamic stochastic general equilibrium DSGE models that describe the dynamics of the whole economy as the result of the interdependent optimizing decisions of workers consumers investors and governments1112Electrical engineeringeditSome common applications of optimization techniques in electrical engineering include active filter design13 stray field reduction in superconducting magnetic energy storage systems space mapping design of microwave structures14 handset antennas151617 electromagnetics-based design Electromagnetically validated design optimization of microwave components and antennas has made extensive use of an appropriate physics-based or empirical surrogate model and space mapping methodologies since the discovery of space mapping in 19931819Civil engineeringeditOptimization has been widely used in civil engineering The most common civil engineering problems that are solved by optimization are cut and fill of roads life-cycle analysis of structures and infrastructures20 resource leveling21 water resource allocation and schedule optimizationOperations researcheditAnother field that uses optimization techniques extensively is operations research22 Operations research also uses stochastic modeling and simulation to support improved decision-making Increasingly operations research uses stochastic programming to model dynamic decisions that adapt to events such problems can be solved with large-scale optimization and stochastic optimization methodsControl engineeringeditMathematical optimization is used in much modern controller design High-level controllers such as model predictive control MPC or real-time optimization RTO employ mathematical optimization These algorithms run online and repeatedly determine values for decision variables such as choke openings in a process plant by iteratively solving a mathematical optimization problem including constraints and a model of the system to be controlledGeophysicseditOptimization techniques are regularly used in geophysical parameter estimation problems Given a set of geophysical measurements eg seismic recordings it is common to solve for
