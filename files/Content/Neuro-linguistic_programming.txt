development and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California United States in the 1970s NLPs creators claim there is a connection between neurological processes neuro- language linguistic and behavioral patterns learned through experience programming and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life12 Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can model the skills of exceptional people allowing anyone to acquire those skills34 They claim as well that often in a single session NLP can treat problems such as phobias depression tic disorders psychosomatic illnesses near-sightedness5 allergy common cold6 and learning disorders78There is no scientific evidence supporting the claims made by NLP advocates and it has been discredited as a pseudoscience91011Scientific reviews state that NLP is based on outdated metaphors of how the brain works that are inconsistent with current neurological theory and contain numerous factual errors1213Reviews also found that all of the supportive research on NLP contained significant methodological flaws and that there were three times as many studies of a much higher quality that failed to reproduce the extraordinary claims made by Bandler Grinder and other NLP practitioners1011Even so NLP has been adopted by some hypnotherapists and also by companies that run seminars marketed as leadership training to businesses and government agencies1412Contents1 History and conception11 Early development12 Commercialization and evaluation2 Main components and core concepts3 Techniques or

methodology termed modeling plus a set of techniques that they derived from its initial applications1516  Of such methods that are considered fundamental they derived many from the work of Virginia Satir Milton Erickson and Fritz Perls17Bandler and Grinder also drew upon the theories of Gregory Bateson Alfred Korzybski and Noam Chomsky particularly transformational grammar151819 as well as ideas and techniques from Carlos Castaneda20Bandler and Grinder claim that their methodology can codify the structure inherent to the therapeutic magic as performed in therapy by Perls Satir and Erickson and indeed inherent to any complex human activity and then from that codification the structure and its activity can be learned by others Their 1975 book The Structure of Magic I A Book about Language and Therapy is intended to be a codification of the therapeutic techniques of Perls and Satir1521Bandler and Grinder say that they used their own process of modeling to model Virginia Satir so they could produce what they termed the Meta-Model a model for gathering information and challenging a clients language and underlying thinking152122 They claim that by challenging linguistic distortions specifying generalizations and recovering deleted information in the clients statements the transformational grammar concepts of surface structure yield a more complete representation of the underlying deep structure and therefore have therapeutic benefit2324 Also derived from Satir were anchoring future pacing and representational systems25In contrast the Milton-Modela model of the purportedly hypnotic language of Milton Ericksonwas described by Bandler and Grinder as artfully vague and metaphoric26 The Milton-Model is used in combination with the Meta-Model as a softener to induce trance and to deliver indirect therapeutic suggestion27However adjunct lecturer in linguistics Karen Stollznow describes Bandlers and Grinders reference to such experts as namedropping Other than Satir the people they cite as influences did not collaborate with Bandler or Grinder Chomsky himself has no association with NLP whatsoever his original work was intended as theory not therapy Stollznow writes other than borrowing terminology NLP does not bear authentic resemblance to any of Chomskys theories or philosophies  linguistic cognitive or political18According to Andr Muller Weitzenhoffer a researcher in the field of hypnosis the major weakness of Bandler and Grinders linguistic analysis is that so much of it is built upon untested hypotheses and is supported by totally inadequate data28  Weitzenhoffer adds that Bandler and Grinder misuse formal logic and mathematics29 redefine or misunderstand terms from the linguistics lexicon eg nominalization30 create a scientific faade by needlessly complicating Ericksonian concepts with unfounded claims31 make factual errors32  and disregard or confuse concepts central to the Ericksonian approach33More recently circa 1997 Bandler has claimed NLP is based on finding out what works and formalizing it In order to formalize patterns I utilized everything from linguistics to holographyThe models that constitute NLP are all formal models based on mathematical logical principles such as predicate calculus and the mathematical equations underlying holography34  However there is no mention of the mathematics of holography nor of holography in general in McClendons35 Spitzers25 or Grinders36 account of the development of NLPOn the matter of the development of NLP Grinder recollects37My memories about what we thought at the time of discovery with respect to the classic code we developed  that is the years 1973 through 1978 are that we were quite explicit that we were out to overthrow a paradigm and that for example I for one found it very useful to plan this campaign using in part as a guide the excellent work of Thomas Kuhn The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in which he detailed some of the conditions which historically have obtained in the midst of paradigm shifts For example I believe it was very useful that neither one of us were qualified in the field we first went after  psychology and in particular its therapeutic application this being one of the conditions which Kuhn identified in his historical study of paradigm shiftsThe philosopher Robert Todd Carroll responded that Grinder has not understood Kuhns text on the history and philosophy of science The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Carroll replies a individual scientists never have nor are they ever able to create paradigm shifts volitionally and Kuhn does not suggest otherwise b Kuhns text does not contain the idea that being unqualified in a field of science is a prerequisite to producing a result that necessitates a paradigm shift in that field and c The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is foremost a work of history and not an instructive text on creating paradigm shifts and such a text is not possibleextraordinary discovery is not a formulaic procedure Carroll explains that a paradigm shift is not a planned activity rather it is an outcome of scientific effort within the current dominant paradigm that produces data that cant be adequately accounted for within the current paradigmhence a paradigm shift ie the adoption of a new paradigmIn developing NLP Bandler and Grinder were not responding to a paradigmatic crisis in psychology nor did they produce any data that caused a paradigmatic crisis in psychology There is no sense in which Bandler and Grinder caused or participated in a paradigm shift What did Grinder and Bandler do that makes it impossible to continue doing psychologywithout accepting their ideas Nothing argues Carroll38Commercialization and evaluationBy the late 1970s the human potential movement had developed into an industry and provided a market for some NLP ideas At the center of this growth was the Esalen Institute at Big Sur California Perls had led numerous Gestalt therapy seminars at Esalen Satir was an early leader and Bateson was a guest teacher Bandler and Grinder claimed that in addition to being a therapeutic method NLP was also a study of communication and began marketing it as a business tool claiming that if any human being can do anything so can you22 After 150 students paid 1000 each for a ten-day workshop in Santa Cruz California Bandler and Grinder gave up academic writing and produced popular books from seminar transcripts such as Frogs into Princes which sold more than 270000 copies According to court documents relating to an intellectual property dispute between Bandler and Grinder Bandler made more than 800000 in 1980 from workshop and book sales22A community of psychotherapists and students began to form around Bandler and Grinders initial works leading to the growth and spread of NLP as a theory and practice39 For example Tony Robbins trained with Grinder and utilized a few ideas from NLP as part of his own self-help and motivational speaking programmes40 Bandler led several unsuccessful efforts to exclude other parties from using NLP41 Meanwhile the rising number of practitioners and theorists led NLP to become even less uniform than it was at its foundation18 Prior to the decline of NLP scientific researchers began testing its theoretical underpinnings empirically with research indicating a lack of empirical support for NLPs essential theories11  The 1990s were characterized by fewer scientific studies evaluating the methods of NLP than the previous decade Tomasz Witkowski attributes this to a declining interest in the debate as the result of a lack of empirical support for NLP from its proponents11Main components and core conceptsNLP can be understood in terms of three broad components and the central concepts pertaining to thoseSubjectivity  According to Bandler and GrinderWe experience the world subjectively thus we create subjective representations of our experience These subjective representations of experience are constituted in terms of five senses and language That is to say our subjective conscious experience is in terms of the traditional senses of vision audition tactition olfaction and gustation such that when wefor examplerehearse an activity in our heads recall an event or anticipate the future we will see images hear sounds taste flavours feel tactile sensations smell odours and think in some natural language4243  Furthermore it is claimed that these subjective representations of experience have a discernible structure a pattern It is in this sense that NLP is sometimes defined as the study of the structure of subjective experience44Behavior can be described and understood in terms of these sense-based subjective representations Behavior is broadly conceived to include verbal and non-verbal communication incompetent maladaptive or pathological behavior as well as effective or skillful behavior4546Behavior in self and others can be modified by manipulating these sense-based subjective representations474849505152Consciousness  NLP is predicated on the notion that consciousness is bifurcated into a conscious component and an unconscious component Those subjective representations that occur outside of an individuals awareness comprise what is referred to as the unconscious mind53Learning  NLP utilizes an imitative method of learningtermed modelingthat is claimed to be able to codify and reproduce an exemplars expertise in any domain of activity An important part of the codification process is a description of the sequence of the sensorylinguistic representations of the subjective experience of the exemplar during execution of the expertise54555657Techniques or set of practicesFurther information Methods of neuro-linguistic programming  An eye accessing cue chart as it appears as an example in Bandler  Grinders Frogs into Princes 1979 The six directions represent visual construct visual recall auditory construct auditory recall kinesthetic and auditory internal dialogueAccording to one study by Steinbach58 a classic interaction in NLP can be understood in terms of several major stages including establishing rapport gleaning information about a problem mental state and desired goals using specific tools and techniques to make interventions and integrating proposed changes into the clients life The entire process is guided by the non-verbal responses of the client58 The first is the act of establishing and maintaining rapport between the practitioner and the client which is achieved through pacing and leading the verbal eg sensory predicates and keywords and non-verbal behavior eg matching and mirroring non-verbal behavior or responding to eye movements of the client59Once rapport is established the practitioner may gather information eg using the Meta-Model questions about the clients present state as well as help the client define a desired state or goal for the interaction The practitioner pays particular attention to the verbal and non-verbal responses as the client defines the present state and desired state and any resources that may be required to bridge the gap58 The client is typically encouraged to consider the consequences of the desired outcome and how they may affect his or her personal or professional life and relationships taking into account any positive intentions of any problems that may arise ie ecological check58 Fourth the practitioner assists the client in achieving the desired outcomes by using certain tools and techniques to change internal representations and responses to stimuli in the world6061 Finally the changes are future paced by helping the client to mentally rehearse and integrate the changes into his or her life58 For example the client may be asked to step into the future and represent mentally see hear and feel what it is like having already achieved the outcomeAccording to Stollznow 2010 NLP also involves fringe discourse analysis and practical guidelines for improved communication For example one text asserts when you adopt the but word people will remember what you said afterwards With the and word people remember what you said before and after18ApplicationsAlternative medicineNLP has been promoted with claims it can be used to treat a variety of diseases including Parkinsons disease HIVAIDS and cancer62 Such claims have no supporting medical evidence62 People who use NLP as a form of treatment risk serious adverse health consequences as it can delay the provision of effective medical care62PsychotherapeuticEarly books about NLP had a psychotherapeutic focus given that the early models were psychotherapists As an approach to psychotherapy NLP shares similar core assumptions and foundations in common with some contemporary brief and systemic practices636465 such as solution focused brief therapy6667 NLP has also been acknowledged as having influenced these practices6568 with its reframing techniques6970 which seeks to achieve behavior change by shifting its context or meaning71 for example by finding the positive connotation of a thought or behaviorThe two main therapeutic uses of NLP are 1 as an adjunct by therapists72 practicing in other therapeutic disciplines 2 as a specific therapy called Neurolinguistic Psychotherapy73 which is recognized by the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy74 with accreditation governed at first by the Association for Neuro Linguistic Programming75 and more recently by its daughter organization the Neuro Linguistic Psychotherapy and Counselling Association76  Neither Neuro-Linguistic Programming nor Neuro-Linguistic Psychotherapy are NICE-approved77According to Stollznow 2010 Bandler and Grinders infamous Frogs into Princes and their other books boast that NLP is a cure-all that treats a broad range of physical and mental conditions and learning difficulties including epilepsy myopia and dyslexia With its promises to cure schizophrenia depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and its dismissal of psychiatric illnesses as psychosomatic NLP shares similarities with Scientology and the Citizens Commission on Human Rights CCHR18  A systematic review of experimental studies by Sturt et al 2012 concluded that there is little evidence that NLP interventions improve health-related outcomes78  In his review of NLP Stephen Briers writes NLP is not really a cohesive therapy but a ragbag of different techniques without a particularly clear theoretical basisand its evidence base is virtually non-existent79  Eisner writes NLP appears to be a superficial and gimmicky approach to dealing with mental health problems Unfortunately NLP appears to be the first in a long line of mass marketing seminars that purport to virtually cure any mental disorderit appears that NLP has no empirical or scientific support as to the underlying tenets of its theory or clinical effectiveness What remains is a mass-marketed serving of psychopablum80Andr Muller Weitzenhoffera friend and peer of Milton Ericksonwrote Has NLP really abstracted and explicated the essence of successful therapy and provided everyone with the means to be another Whittaker Virginia Satir or EricksonNLPs failure to do this is evident because today there is no multitude of their equals not even another Whittaker Virginia Satir or Erickson Ten years should have been sufficient time for this to happen In this light I cannot take NLP seriouslyNLPs contributions to our understanding and use of Ericksonian techniques are equally dubious Patterns I and II are poorly written works that were an overambitious pretentious effort to reduce hypnotism to a magic of words81Clinical psychologist Stephen Briers questions the value of the NLP maxima presupposition in NLP jargonthere is no failure only feedback82  Briers argues that the denial of the existence of failure diminishes its instructive value He offers Walt Disney Isaac Newton and JK Rowling as three examples of unambiguous acknowledged personal failure that served as an impetus to great success According to Briers it was the crash-and-burn type of failure not the sanitised NLP Failure Lite ie the failure-that-isnt really-failure sort of failure that propelled these individuals to success Briers contends that adherence to the maxim leads to self-deprecation According to Briers personal endeavour is a product of invested values and aspirations and the dismissal of personally significant failure as mere feedback effectively denigrates what one values Briers writes Sometimes we need to accept and mourn the death of our dreams not just casually dismiss them as inconsequential NLPs reframe casts us into the role of a widower avoiding the pain of grief by leap-frogging into a rebound relationship with a younger woman never pausing to say a proper goodbye to his dead wife  Briers also contends that the NLP maxim is narcissistic self-centered and divorced from notions of moral responsibility83Other usesAlthough the original core techniques of NLP were therapeutic in orientation their generic nature enabled them to be applied to other fields These applications include persuasion41 sales84 negotiation85 management training86 sports87 teaching coaching team building and public speakingScientific criticismIn the early 1980s NLP was advertised as an important advance in psychotherapy and counseling and attracted some interest in counseling research and clinical psychologyHowever as controlled trials failed to show any benefit from NLP and its advocates made increasingly dubious claims scientific interest in NLP faded8889Numerous literature reviews and meta-analyses have failed to show evidence for NLPs assumptions or effectiveness as a therapeutic method90While some NLP practitioners have argued that the lack of empirical support is due to insufficient research testing NLP91 the consensus scientific opinion is that NLP is pseudoscience92 and that attempts to dismiss the research findings based on these arguments constitutes an admission that NLP does not have an evidence base and that NLP practitioners are seeking a post-hoc credibility93Surveys in the academic community have shown NLP to be widely discredited among scientists94Among the reasons for considering NLP a pseudoscience are that evidence in favor of it is limited to anecdotes and personal testimony95that it is not informed by scientific understanding of neuroscience and linguistics96and that the name neuro-linguistic programming uses jargon words to impress readers and obfuscate ideas whereas NLP itself does not relate any phenomena to neural structures and has nothing in common with linguistics or programming97 In fact in education NLP has been used as a key example of pseudoscience98As a quasi-religionSociologists and anthropologistsamongst othershave categorized NLP as a quasi-religion belonging to the New Age andor Human Potential Movements99100101102103104105106107108  Medical anthropologist Jean M Langford categorizes NLP as a form of folk magic that is to say a practice with symbolic efficacyas opposed to physical efficacythat is able to effect change through nonspecific effects eg placebo To Langford NLP is akin to a syncretic folk religion that attempts to wed the magic of folk practice to the science of professional medicine109  Bandler and Grinder were and continue to be110111 influenced by the shamanism described in the books of Carlos Castaneda Several ideas and techniques have been borrowed from Castaneda and incorporated into NLP including so-called double induction20 and the notion of stopping the world112 which is central to NLP modeling Tye 1994113 characterizes NLP as a type of psycho shamanism Fanthorpe and Fanthorpe 2008114 see a similarity between the mimetic procedure and intent of NLP modeling and aspects of ritual in some syncretic religions Hunt 200399 draws a comparison between the concern with lineage from an NLP guruwhich is evident amongst some NLP proponentsand the concern with guru lineage in some Eastern religionsIn Aupers and Houtman 2010103 Bovbjerg identifies NLP as a New Age psycho-religion and uses NLP as a case-study to demonstrate the thesis that the New Age psycho-religions such as NLP are predicated on an instrinsically religious idea namely concern with a transcendent other In the worlds monotheistic faiths argues Bovbjerg the purpose of religious practice is communion and fellowship with a  transcendent other ie a God   With the New Age psycho-religions argues Bovbjerg this orientation towards a transcendent other persists but the other has become the other in our selves the so-called unconscious the individuals inner life becomes the intangible focus of psycho-religious practices and the subconscious becomes a constituent part of modern individuals understanding of the Self  Bovbjerg adds courses in personal development would make no sense without an unconscious that contains hidden resources and hidden knowledge of the self  Thus psycho-religious practice revolves around ideas of the conscious and unconscious self and communicating with and accessing the hidden resources of the unconscious selfthe transcendent other According to Bovbjerg the notion that we have an unconscious self underlies many NLP techniques either explicitly or implicitly Bovbjerg argues through particular practices the NLP practitioner qua psycho-religious practitioner expects to achieve self-perfection in a never-ending transformation of the selfBovbjergs secular critique of NLP is echoed in the conservative Christian perspective of the New Age as represented by Jeremiah 1995115 who argues that the transformation recommended by the founders and leaders of these business seminars such as NLP has spiritual implications that a non-Christian or new believer may not recognise The belief that human beings can change themselves by calling upon the power or god within or their own infinite human potential is a contradiction of the Christian view The Bible says man is a sinner and is saved by Gods grace aloneIntellectual property disputesBy the end of 1980 the collaboration between Bandler and Grinder ended22  On 25 September 1981 Bandler instituted a civil action against Grinder and his company seeking injunctive relief and damages for Grinders commercial activity in relation to NLP On 29 October 1981 judgement was made in favor of Bandler116  As part of a settlement agreement Bandler granted to Grinder a limited 10-year license to conduct NLP seminars offer certification in NLP and use the NLP name on the condition that royalties from the earnings of the seminars be paid to Bandler In July 1996 and January 1997 Bandler instituted a further two civil actions against Grinder and his company numerous other prominent figures in NLP and 200 further initially unnamed persons Bandler alleged that Grinder had violated the terms of the settlement agreement reached in the initial case and had suffered commercial damage as a result of the allegedly illegal commercial activities of the defendants Bandler sought from each defendant damages no less than US1000000000117118  In February 2000 the Court found against Bandler stating that Bandler has misrepresented to the public through his licensing agreement and promotional materials that he is the exclusive owner of all intellectual property rights associated with NLP and maintains the exclusive authority to determine membership in and certification in the Society of NLP119120On this matter Stollznow 201018 comments ironically Bandler and Grinder feuded in the 1980s over trademark and theory disputes Tellingly none of their myriad of NLP models pillars and principles helped these founders to resolve their personal and professional conflictsIn December 1997 Tony Clarkson instituted civil proceedings against Bandler to have Bandlers UK trademark of NLP revoked The Court found in favor of Clarkson Bandlers trademark was subsequently revoked121122By the end of 2000 Bandler and Grinder entered a release where they agreed amongst other things that they are the co-creators and co-founders of the technology of Neuro-linguistic Programming and mutually agree to refrain from disparaging each others efforts in any fashion concerning their respective involvement in the field of NeuroLinguistic Programming123As a consequence of these disputes and settlements the names NLP and Neuro-linguistic Programming are not owned by any party and there is no restriction on any party offering NLP certification124125126127128Associations certification and practitioner standardsThe names NLP and Neuro-linguistic Programming are not owned by any person or organisation they are not trademarked intellectual property129130 and there is no central regulating authority for NLP instruction and certification127128  There is no restriction on who can describe themselves as an NLP Master Practitioner or NLP Master Trainer and there are a multitude of certifying associations131 this has led Devilly 2005 to describe such training and certifying associations as granfalloons ie proud and meaningless associations of human beings88There is great variation in the depth and breadth of training and standards of practitioners and some disagreement between those in the field about which patterns are or are not actual NLP10132 NLP is  an open field of training with no official best practice With different authors individual trainers and practitioners having developed their own methods concepts and labels often branding them as NLP38 the training standards and quality differ greatly133  In 2009 a British television presenter was able to register his pet cat as a member of the British Board of Neuro Linguistic Programming BBNLP which subsequently claimed that it existed only to provide benefits to its members and not to certify credentials134See alsoEmotional freedom techniqueList of unproven and disproven cancer treatmentsMilton H EricksonFamily systems therapyFrank

isnt there a way to maintain that I noticed when I hypnotically regressed people to before the age of 5 who currently wore glasses didnt need them to see So I started leaving peoples eyes young and growing the rest of them up to the present and it would change the prescription of their glasses radically to the point where they could see better And done enough times some of them could see without glasses So I went a little step further and did a DHE Design Human Engineering treatment where we set up a mechanism in the back of their mind that repeatedly age regresses them hypnotically when they sleep when they blink all kinds of things and in a state of time distortion And it can take years off the way people look it also ups their energy level and in some cases the bi product sic has been they recovered spontaneously from very serious diseases Because they were aged regressed to where before the disease started Now I cannot prove that but Ive seen it enough times that Im impressed with

of metaphor and hypnosis and Milton Ericksons language patterns and metaphor to induce an altered state of consciousness to create deep trance phenomena One of the most dynamic techniques which evolved out of the hypnosis programs was the use of the double induction The double induction is a trance induction carried out by two people One person speaks into one ear using complex words and language patterns to occupy one brain hemisphere and the other person speaks into the other ear using childlike grammar and language to occupy the other brain hemisphere The feeling sensations are experienced in the same half of the body as the auditory input This technique was used in conversations that Carlos Castaneda had with don Juan and don Genaro This technique was used frequently during

showing some of the inherent weaknesses in their treatment Muller Weitzenhoffer Andr 1989 Chapter 8 Ericksonian Hypnotism The BandlerGrinder Interpretation The Practice of Hypnotism Volume 2

references made to left and right brain functions in relation to hypnotic phenomena must be considered as poorly founded They do not add to our understanding of nor our ability to utilize hypnotic phenomena in the style of Erickson Indeed references such as Bandler and Grinder make to these functions give their subject matter a false appearance of having a more scientific status than it has

Subjective Experience Limited ed California Meta Publications pp1314 ISBN978-0-916990-07-7 There are three characteristics of effective patterning in NLP which sharply distinguish it from behavioural science as it is commonly practiced today First for a pattern or generalization regarding human communication to be acceptable or wellformed in NLP it must include in the description the human agents who are initiating and responding to the pattern being described their actions their possible responses Secondly the description of the pattern must be represented in sensory grounded terms which are available to the user This useroriented constraint on NLP ensures usefulness We have been continually struck by the tremendous gap between theory and practice in the behavioural sciencesthis requirement closes that gap Notice that since patterns must be represented in sensory grounded terms available through practice to the user a pattern will typically have multiple representationeach tailored for the differing sensory capabilities of individual usersThirdly NLP includes within its descriptive vocabulary terms which are not directly observable ie representational systems Dilts

members of the species operate on their environment vision sight audition hearing kinesthesis body sensations and olfactiongustation smelltaste The neurolinguistic programming model presupposes that all of the distinctions we as human beings are able to make concerning our environment internal and external and our behaviour can be usefully represented in terms of these systems These perceptual classes constitute the structural parameters of human knowledge We postulate that all of our ongoing experience can usefully be coded as consisting of some combination of these sensory classes Grinder
