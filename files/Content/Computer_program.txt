Computer program - WikipediaComputer programFrom Wikipedia the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchInstructions to be executed by a computerFor the TV program see The Computer Programme  hello world computer program by Brian Kernighan 1978A computer program is a collection of instructions1 that performs a specific task when executed by a computer Most computer devices require programs to function properlyA computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language From the program in its human-readable form of source code a compiler or assembler can derive machine codea form consisting of instructions that the computer can directly execute Alternatively a computer program may be executed with the aid of an interpreterA collection of computer programs libraries and related data are referred to as software Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines such as application software and system software  The underlying method used for some calculation or manipulation is known as an algorithmContents1 History11 Early programmable machines12 Analytical Engine13 Universal Turing machine14 Early programmable computers15 Later

readingHistoryeditSee also History of computing History of programming languages and History of softwareCode-breaking algorithms have existed for centuries In the 9th century the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code in A Manuscript On Deciphering Cryptographic Messages He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis the earliest code-breaking algorithm2Early programmable machineseditThe earliest programmable machines preceded the invention of the digital computer As early as the 9th century a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices34 In 1206 the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where musical mechanical automata could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns5 In 1801 Joseph-Marie Jacquard devised a loom that would weave a pattern by following a series of perforated cards Patterns could be woven and repeated by arranging the cards6Analytical Engineedit  Lovelaces diagram from Note G the first published computer algorithmIn 1837 Charles Babbage was inspired by Jacquards loom to attempt to build the Analytical Engine6The names of the components of the calculating device were borrowed from the textile industry In the textile industry yarn was brought from the store to be milled The device would have had a storememory to hold 1000 numbers of 40 decimal digits each  Numbers from the store would then have then been transferred to the mill analogous to the CPU of a modern machine for processing And a thread being the execution of programmed instructions by the device It was programmed using two sets of perforated cardsone to direct the operation and the other for the input variables67 However after more than 17000 pounds of the British governments money the thousands of cogged wheels and gears never fully worked together8During a nine-month period in 184243 Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea The memoir covered the Analytical Engine The translation contained Note G which completely detailed a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine This note is recognized by some historians as the worlds first written computer program9Universal Turing machineeditIn 1936 Alan Turing introduced the Universal Turing machinea theoretical device that can model every computation that can be performed on a Turing complete computing machine10It is a finite-state machine that has an infinitely long readwrite tape The machine can move the tape back and forth changing its contents as it performs an algorithm The machine starts in the initial state goes through a sequence of steps and halts when it encounters the halt state11This machine is considered by some to be the origin of the stored-program computerused by John von Neumann 1946 for the Electronic Computing Instrument that now bears the von Neumann architecture name12Early programmable computerseditThe Z3 computer invented by Konrad Zuse 1941 in Germany was a digital and programmable computer13 A digital computer uses electricity as the calculating component The Z3 contained 2400 relays to create the circuits The circuits provided a binary floating-point nine-instruction computer Programming the Z3 was through a specially designed keyboard and punched tapeThe Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer Fall 1945 was a Turing complete general-purpose computer that used 17468 vacuum tubes to create the circuits At its core it was a series of Pascalines wired together14 Its 40 units weighed 30 tons occupied 1800 square feet 167m2 and consumed 650 per hour in 1940s currency in electricity when idle14 It had 20 base-10 accumulators Programming the ENIAC took up to two months14 Three function tables were on wheels and needed to be rolled to fixed function panels Function tables were connected to function panels using heavy black cables Each function table had 728 rotating knobs Programming the ENIAC also involved setting some of the 3000 switches Debugging a program took a week14  The programmers of the ENIAC were women who were known collectively as the ENIAC girls15 and included Jean Jennings Bartik Betty Holberton Marlyn Wescoff Kathleen McNulty Ruth Teitelbaum and Frances Spence16The ENIAC featured parallel operations Different sets of accumulators could simultaneously work on different algorithms It used punched card machines for input and output and it was controlled with a clock signal It ran for eight years calculating hydrogen bomb parameters predicting weather patterns and producing firing tables to aim artillery guns The Manchester Baby June 1948 was a stored-program computer17 Programming transitioned away from moving cables and setting dials instead a computer program was stored in memory as numbers Only three bits of memory were available to store each instruction so it was limited to eight instructions 32 switches were available for programmingLater computersedit  Switches for manual input on a Data General Nova 3 manufactured in the mid-1970sComputers manufactured until the 1970s had front-panel switches for programming The computer program was written on paper for reference An instruction was represented by a configuration of onoff settings After setting the configuration an execute button was pressed This process was then repeated Computer programs also were manually input via paper tape or punched cards After the medium was loaded the starting address was set via switches and the execute button pressed18In 1961 the Burroughs B5000 was built specifically to be programmed in the ALGOL 60 language The hardware featured circuits to ease the compile phase19In 1964 the IBM System360 was a line of six computers each having the same instruction set architecture The Model 30 was the smallest and least expensive Customers could upgrade and retain the same application software20 Each System360 model featured multiprogramming With operating system support multiple programs could be in memory at once When one was waiting for inputoutput another could compute Each model also could emulate other computers Customers could upgrade to the System360 and retain their IBM 7094 or IBM 1401 application software20Computer programmingeditMain article Computer programmingComputer programming is the process of writing or editing source code Editing source code involves testing analyzing refining and sometimes coordinating with other programmers on a jointly developed program A person who practices this skill is referred to as a computer programmer software developer and sometimes coderThe sometimes lengthy process of computer programming is usually referred to as software development The term software engineering is becoming popular as the process is seen as an engineering disciplineProgramming languageseditMain article Programming language  A computer program written in the imperative programming styleComputer programs can be categorized by the programming language paradigm used to produce them Two of the main paradigms are imperative and declarativeImperative languageseditImperative programming languages specify a sequential algorithm using declarations expressions and statements21A declaration couples a variable name to a datatype  for example  var x integer An expression yields a value  for example  2  2  yields 4A statement might assign an expression to a variable or use the value of a variable to alter the programs control flow  for example x 2  2 if x  4 then dosomethingOne criticism of imperative languages is the side effect of an assignment statement on a class of variables called non-local variables22Declarative languageseditDeclarative programming languages describe what computation should be performed and not how to compute it Declarative programs omit the control flow and are considered sets of instructions Two broad categories of declarative languages are functional languages and logical languages The principle behind functional languages like Haskell is to not allow side effects which makes it easier to reason about programs like mathematical functions22 The principle behind logical languages like Prolog is to define the problem to be solved the goal and leave the detailed solution to the Prolog system itself23 The goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals etc If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution then that subgoal is backtracked and another path is systematically attemptedCompilation and interpretationeditA computer program in the form of a human-readable computer programming language is called source code Source code may be converted into an executable image by a compiler or assembler or executed immediately with the aid of an interpreterCompilers are used to translate source code from a programming language into either object code or machine code24  Object code needs further processing to become machine code and machine code consists of the central processing units native instructions ready for execution Compiled computer programs are commonly referred to as executables binary images or simply as binaries a reference to the binary file format used to store the executable codeSome compiled and assembled object programs need to be combined as modules with a linker utility in order to produce an executable programInterpreters are used to execute source code from a programming language line-by-line The interpreter decodes each statement and performs its behavior One advantage of interpreters is that they can easily be extended to an interactive session The programmer is presented with a prompt and individual lines of code are typed in and performed immediatelyThe main disadvantage of interpreters is computer programs run slower than when compiled Interpreting code is slower because the interpreter must decode each statement and then perform it However software development may be faster using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compiling step is omitted Another disadvantage of interpreters is an interpreter must be present on the executing computer By contrast compiled computer programs need no compiler present during executionJust in time compilers pre-compile computer programs just before execution For example the Java virtual machine Hotspot contains a Just In Time Compiler which selectively compiles Java bytecode into machine code  but only code which Hotspot predicts is likely to be used many timesEither compiled or interpreted programs might be executed in a batch process without human interactionScripting languages are often used to create batch processes One common scripting language is Unix shell and its executing environment is called the command-line interfaceNo properties of a programming language require it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted The categorization usually reflects the most popular method of language execution For example Java is thought of as an interpreted language and C a compiled language despite the existence of Java compilers and C interpretersStorage and executionedit  In the 1950s computer programs were stored on perforated paper tapeTypically computer programs are stored in non-volatile memory until requested either directly or indirectly to be executed by the computer user Upon such a request the program is loaded into random-access memory by a computer program called an operating system where it can be accessed directly by the central processor The central processor then executes runs the program instruction by instruction until termination A program in execution is called a process25 Termination is either by normal self-termination by user intervention or by error software or hardware errorSimultaneous executioneditSee also Process computing and MultiprocessingMany operating systems support multitasking which enables many computer programs to appear to run simultaneously on one computer  Operating systems may run multiple programs through process scheduling a software mechanism to switch the CPU among processes often so users can interact with each program while it runs26 Within hardware modern day multiprocessor computers or computers with multicore processors may run multiple programs27Self-modifying programseditMain article Self-modifying codeA computer program in execution is normally treated as being different from the data the program operates on However in some cases this distinction is blurred when a computer program modifies itself The modified computer program is subsequently executed as part of the same program Self-modifying code is possible for programs written in machine code assembly language Lisp C COBOL PL1 and PrologFunctional categorieseditComputer programs may be categorized along functional lines The main functional categories are application software and system software System software includes the operating system which couples computer hardware with application software28 The purpose of the operating system is to provide an environment in which application software executes in a convenient and efficient manner28 In addition to the operating system system software includes embedded programs boot programs and micro programs Application software designed for end users have a user interface Application software not designed for the end user includes middleware which couples one application with another Application software also includes utility programs The distinction between system software and application software is under debateApplication softwareeditMain article Application software  Example of an app GCalctool a software calculatorThere are many types of application softwareThe word app came to being in 21st century It is a clipping of the word application They have been designed for many platforms but the word was first used for smaller mobile apps Desktop apps are traditional computer programs that run on desktop computers Mobile apps run on mobile devices Web apps run inside a web browser Both mobile and desktop apps may be downloaded from the developers website or purchased from app stores such as Microsoft Store Apple App Store Mac App Store Google Play or Intel AppUpAn application suite consists of multiple applications bundled together Examples include Microsoft Office LibreOffice and iWork They bundle a word processor spreadsheet and other applicationsEnterprise applications bundle accounting personnel customer and vendor applications Examples include enterprise resource planning customer relationship management and supply chain management softwareEnterprise infrastructure software supports the enterprises software systems Examples include databases email servers and network serversInformation worker software are designed for workers at the departmental level Examples include time management resource management analytical collaborative and documentation tools Word processors spreadsheets email and blog clients personal information system and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasksMedia development software generates print and electronic media for others to consume most often in a commercial or educational setting These produce graphics publications animations and videosProduct engineering software is used to help develop large machines and other application software Examples includes computer-aided design CAD computer-aided engineering CAE and integrated development environmentsEntertainment Software can refer to video games movie recorders and players and music recorders and playersUtility programseditUtility programs are application programs designed to aid system administrators and computer programmersOperating systemeditSee also Operating systemAn operating system is a computer program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware28In the 1950s the programmer who was also the operator would write a program and run it After the program finished executing the output may have been printed or it may have been punched onto paper tape or cards for later processing18More often than not the program did not workThe programmer then looked at the console lights and fiddled with the console switches If less fortunate a memory printout was made for further studyIn the 1960s programmers reduced the amount of wasted time by automating the operators job A program called an operating system was kept in the computer at all times29Originally operating systems were programmed in assembly however modern operating systems are typically written in CBoot programeditA stored-program computer requires an initial computer program stored in its read-only memory to boot The boot process is to identify and initialize all aspects of the system from processor registers to device controllers to memory contents30 Following the initialization process this initial computer program loads the operating system and sets the program counter to begin normal operationsEmbedded programsedit  The microcontroller on the right of this USB flash drive is controlled with embedded firmwareIndependent of the host computer a hardware device might have embedded firmware to control its operation Firmware is used when the computer program is rarely or never expected to change or when the program must not be lost when the power is off29Microcode programseditMain article MicrocodeMicrocode programs control some central processing units and some other hardware This code moves data between the registers buses arithmetic logic units and other functional units in the CPU  Unlike conventional programs microcode is not usually written by or even visible to the end users of systems and is usually provided by the manufacturer and is considered internal to the deviceSee alsoeditArtificial intelligenceAutomatic programmingComputer virusFirmwareKiller applicationSoftwareSoftware bugReferencesedit Rochkind Marc J 2004 Advanced Unix Programming
