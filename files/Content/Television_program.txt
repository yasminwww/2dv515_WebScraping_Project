televisionThe first television shows were experimental sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the broadcast tower starting in the 1930s Televised events such as the 1936 Summer Olympics in Germany the 1937 coronation of King George VI in the UK and David Sarnoffs famous introduction at the 1939 New York Worlds Fair in the US spurred a growth in the medium but World War II put a halt to development until after the war The 1947 World Series inspired many Americans to buy their first television set and then in 1948 the popular radio show Texaco Star Theater made the move and became the first weekly televised variety show earning host Milton Berle the name Mr Television and demonstrating that the medium was a stable modern form of entertainment which could attract advertisers The first national live television broadcast in the US took place on September 4 1951 when President Harry Trumans speech at the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco was transmitted over ATTs transcontinental cable and microwave radio relay system to broadcast stations in local markets123The first national color broadcast the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade in the US occurred on January 1 1954 During the following ten years most network broadcasts and nearly all local programming continued to be in black-and-white A color transition was announced for the fall of 1965 during which over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later In 1972 the last holdout among daytime network shows converted to color resulting in the first completely all-color network seasonFormats and genreseditSee also List of genres Film and television formats and genresTelevision shows are more varied than most other forms of media due to the wide variety of formats and genres that can be presented A show may be fictional as in comedies and dramas or non-fictional as in documentary news and reality television It may be topical as in the case of a local newscast and some made-for-television films or historical as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series They could be primarily instructional or educational or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game showscitation neededA drama program usually features a set of actors playing characters in a historical or contemporary setting The program follows their lives and adventures Before the 1980s shows except for soap opera-type serials typically remained static without story arcs and the main characters and premise changed littlecitation needed If some change happened to the characters lives during the episode it was usually undone by the end Because of this the episodes could be broadcast in any ordercitation needed Since the 1980s many series feature progressive change in the plot the characters or both For instance Hill Street Blues and St Elsewhere were two of the first American prime time drama television series to have this kind of dramatic structure4bettersourceneeded while the later series Babylon 5 further exemplifies such structure in that it had a predetermined story running over its intended five-season runcitation neededIn 2012 it was reported that television was growing into a larger component of major media companies revenues than film5 Some also noted the increase in quality of some television programs In 2012 Academy-Award-winning film director Steven Soderbergh commenting on ambiguity and complexity of character and narrative stated I think those qualities are now being seen on television and that people who want to see stories that have those kinds of qualities are watching television6ProductioneditThis section does not cite any sources

the concept the characters the crew and cast Then they often pitch it to the various networks in an attempt to find one interested enough to order a prototype first episode of the series known as a pilotcitation needed Eric Coleman an animation executive at Disney told an interviewer One misconception is that its very difficult to get in and pitch your show when the truth is that development executives at networks want very much to hear ideas They want very much to get the word out on what types of shows theyre looking for7To create the pilot the structure and team of the whole series must be put together If audiences respond well to the pilot the network will pick up the show to air it the next season usually Fallcitation needed Sometimes they save it for mid-season or request rewrites and additional review known in the industry as development hellcitation needed Other times they pass entirely forcing the shows creator to shop it around to other networks Many shows never make it past the pilot stagecitation neededThe show hires a stable of writers who usually work in parallel the first writer works on the first episode the second on the second episode etccitation needed When all the writers have been used episode assignment starts again with the first writercitation needed On other shows however the writers work as a team Sometimes they develop story ideas individually and pitch them to the shows creator who folds them together into a script and rewrites themcitation neededIf the show is picked up the network orders a run of episodesusually only six or 13 episodes at first though a season typically consists of at least 22 episodescitation needed The midseason seven and last nine episodes are sometimes called the mid-seven and back nineborrowing the colloquial terms from bowling and golfcitation neededUnited KingdomeditThis section does not cite any sources  February 2017 Learn how and when to remove this template messageThe method of team writing is employed on some longer dramatic series usually running up to a maximum of around 13 episodes The idea for such a program may be generated in-house by one of the networks it could originate from an independent production company sometimes a product of both For example the BBCs long-running soap opera EastEnders is wholly a BBC production whereas its popular drama Life on Mars was developed by Kudos in association with the broadcasterThere are still a significant number of programs usually sitcoms however that are built by just one or two writers and a small close-knit production team These are pitched in the traditional way but since the creators handle all the writing requirements there is a run of six or seven episodes per series once approval has been given Many of the most popular British comedies have been made this way including Monty Pythons Flying Circus albeit with an exclusive team of six writer-performers Fawlty Towers Blackadder and The OfficeOther

often the shows creator is in charge of running the show They pick the crew and help cast the actors approve and sometimes write series plotssome even write or direct major episodeswhile various other producers help to ensure that the show runs smoothly Very occasionally the executive producer will cast themselves in the show As with filmmaking or other electronic media production producing of an individual episode can be divided into three parts pre-production principal photography and post-productionPre-productioneditMain article Pre-production  Arthur Schlesinger JrPre-production begins when a script is approved A director is chosen to plan the episodes final lookPre-production tasks include storyboarding construction of sets props and costumes casting guest stars budgeting acquiring resources like lighting special effects stunts etc Once the show is planned it must then be scheduled scenes are often filmed out of sequence guest actors or even regulars may only be available at certain times Sometimes the principal photography of different episodes must be done at the same time complicating the schedule a guest star might shoot scenes from two episodes on the same afternoon Complex scenes are translated from storyboard to animatics to further clarify the action Scripts are adjusted to meet altering requirementsSome shows have a small stable of directors but also usually rely on outside directors Given the time constraints of broadcasting a single show might have two or three episodes in pre-production one or two episodes in principal photography and a few more in various stages of post-production The task of directing is complex enough that a single director can usually not work on more than one episode or show at a time hence the need for multiple directorsPrincipal photographyeditMain article Principal photographyPrincipal photography is the actual filming of the episode Director actors and crew gather at a television studio or on location for filming or videoing a scene A scene is further divided into shots which should be planned during pre-production Depending on scheduling a scene may be shot in non-sequential order of the story Conversations may be filmed twice from different camera angles often using stand-ins so one actor might perform all their lines in one set of shots and then the other side of the conversation is filmed from the opposite perspective To complete a production on time a second unit may be filming a different scene on another set or location at the same time using a different set of actors an assistant director and a second unit crew A director of photography supervises the lighting of each shot to ensure consistencyLive events are usually covered by Outside Broadcast crews using mobile television studios known as scanners or OB trucks Although varying greatly depending on the era and subject covered these trucks were normally crewed by up to 15 skilled operators and production personnel In the UK for most of the 20th century the BBC was the preeminent provider of outside broadcast coverage BBC crews worked on almost every major event including Royal weddings and funerals major political and sporting events and even drama programmes8Post-productioneditMain article Post-productionOnce principal photography is complete producers coordinate tasks to begin the video editing Visual and digital video effects are added to the film this is often outsourced to companies specializing in these areas Often music is performed with the conductor using the film as a time reference other musical elements may be previously recorded An editor cuts the various pieces of film together adds the musical score and effects determines scene transitions and assembles the completed showBudgets and revenueseditMost television networks throughout the world are commercial dependent on selling advertising time or acquiring sponsorscitation needed Broadcasting executives main concern over their programming is on audience sizecitation needed Once the number of free to air stations was restricted by the availability of channel frequencies but cable TV outside the United States satellite television technology has allowed an expansion in the number of channels available to viewers sometimes at premium rates in a much more competitive environmentcitation neededIn the United States the average broadcast network drama costs 3million an episode to produce while cable dramas cost 2million on average9 The pilot episode may be more expensive than a regular episodecitation needed In 2004 Losts two-hour pilot cost 10 to14million in 2008 Fringes two-hour pilot cost 10million and in 2010 Boardwalk Empire was 18million for the first episode In 2011 Game of Thrones was 5 to 10million Pan Am cost an estimated 10million while Terra Novas two-hour pilot was between 10 to 20million1011Many scripted network television shows in the United States are financed through deficit financing a studio finances the production cost of a show and a network pays a license fee to the studio for the right to air the show This license fee does not cover the shows production costs leading to the deficit Although the studio does not make its money back in the original airing of the show it retains ownership of the show This ownership retention allows the studio to make its money back and earn a profit through syndication and sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs This system places most of the financial risk on the studios however a show that is a hit in the syndication and home video markets can more than make up for the misses Although the deficit financing system places minimal financial risk on the networks they lose out on the future profits of big hits since they are only licensing the shows12Costs are recouped mainly by advertising revenues for broadcast networks and some cable channels while other cable channels depend on subscription revenues In general advertisers and consequently networks that depend on advertising revenues are more interested in the number of viewers within the 1849 age range than the total number of viewers1314 Advertisers are willing to pay more to advertise on shows successful with young adults because they watch less television and are harder to reach than older adults15 According to Advertising Age during the 200708 season Greys Anatomy was able to charge 419000 per commercial compared to only 248000 for a commercial during CSI despite CSI having almost five million more viewers on average16 Due to its strength in young demos Friends was able to charge almost three times as much for a commercial as Murder She Wrote even though the two series had similar total viewer numbers during the seasons they were on the air together13 Glee and The Office drew fewer total viewers than NCIS during the 200910 season but earned an average of 272694 and 213617 respectively compared to 150708 for NCIS17DistributioneditThis section does not cite any sources Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources Unsourced material may be challenged and removedFind

the television network which sends it out to its affiliate stations which broadcast it in the specified broadcast programming time slot If the Nielsen ratings are good the show is kept alive as long as possible If not the show is usually canceled The shows creators are then left to shop around remaining episodes and the possibility of future episodes to other networks On especially successful series the producers sometimes call a halt to a series on their own like Seinfeld The Cosby Show Corner Gas and MASH and end it with a concluding episode which sometimes is a big series finaleOn rare occasions a series that has not attracted particularly high ratings and has been canceled can be given a reprieve if home video viewership has been particularly strong This has happened in the cases of Family Guy in the US and Peep Show in the UKIn the United States if the show is popular or lucrative and a minimum number of episodes usually 100 have been made it can go into broadcast syndication

template messageIn North American television a series is a connected set of television program episodes that run under the same title possibly spanning many seasons Since the late 1960s this broadcast programming schedule typically includes between 20 and 26 episodes Before then a regular television season could average at least 30 episodes and some TV series may have had as many as 39 episodes in a seasonUntil the 1980s most but certainly not all new programs for the American broadcast networks debuted in the fall season which ran from September through March and nominally contained from 24 to 26 episodes These episodes were rebroadcast during the spring or summer season from April through August Because of cable television and the Nielsen sweeps the fall season now normally extends to May Thus a full season on a broadcast network now usually runs from September through May for at least 22 episodes18A full season is sometimes split into two separate units with a hiatus around the end of the calendar year such as the first season of Jericho on CBS When this split occurs the last half of the episodes sometimes are referred to with the letter B as in The last nine episodes of The Sopranos will be part of what is being called either Season 6 Part 2 or Season 6B19 or in Futurama is splitting its seasons similar to how South Park does doing half a season at a time so this is season 6B for them20 Since the 1990s these shorter seasons also have been referred to as 5 or half seasons where the run of shows between September and December is labeled Season X and the second run between January and May labeled Season X5 Examples of this include the 2004 incarnation of Battlestar Galactica ABCs FlashForward and ABC Familys Make It or Break ItSince at least the 2000s new broadcast television series are often ordered funded for just the first 10 to 13 episodes to gauge audience interest If a series is popular the network places a back nine order and the season is completed to the regular 20 to 26 episodes An established series which is already popular however will typically receive an immediate full-season order at the outset of the season A midseason replacement is a less-expensive short-run show of generally 10 to 13 episodes designed to take the place of an original series that failed to garner an audience and has not been picked up A series finale is the last show of the series before the show is no longer produced In the UK it means the end of a season what is known in the United States as a season finaleA standard television season in the United States runs predominantly across the fall and winter from late September to May During the summer months of June through roughly mid-September network schedules typically feature reruns of their flagship programs first-run series with lower ratings expectations and other specials First-run scripted series are typically shorter and of a lower profile than those aired during the main season and can also include limited series events Reality and game shows have also been a fixture of the scheduleIn Canada the commercial networks air most US programming in tandem with the US television season but their original Canadian shows follow a model closer to British than American television production Due to the smaller production budgets available in Canada a Canadian shows season normally runs to a maximum of 13 episodes rather than 20 or more although an exceptionally popular series such as Corner Gas or Murdoch Mysteries might receive 20-episode orders in later seasons Canadian shows do not normally receive back nine extensions within the same season however even a popular series simply ends for the year when the original production order has finished airing and an expanded order of more than 13 episodes is applied to the next seasons renewal order rather than an extension of the current season Only the public CBC Television normally schedules Canadian-produced programming throughout the year the commercial networks typically now avoid scheduling Canadian productions to air in the fall as such shows commonly get lost amid the publicity onslaught of the US fall season Instead Canadian-produced shows on the commercial networks typically air either in the winter as mid-season replacements for cancelled US shows or in the summer which may also improve their chances of being picked up by a US network for a summer run21Miniseries limited series and event serieseditWhile network orders for 13- or 22-episode seasons are still pervasive in the television industry several shows have deviated from this traditional trend Written to be closed-ended and of shorter length than other shows they are marketed with a variety of termsMiniseries a very short closed-ended series typically six or more hours in two or more parts nights similar to an extended television movie Many early miniseries were adaptations of popular novels of the day such as The National Dream 1974 Roots 1977 and North and South 1985 In recent years as described by several television executives interviewed by The Hollywood Reporter the term miniseries has grown to have negative connotations within the industry having become associated with melodrama-heavy works that were commonly produced under the format while limited series or event series receive higher respect22Limited series distinct from miniseries in that the production is seen to have potential to be renewed but without the requirement of it having as many episodes as a typical order per season Under the Dome Killer Women and Luther were marketed as limited series Individual season-length stories of anthology series such as American Horror Story Fargo and True Detective are also described as limited series The Primetime Emmys have had to make numerous changes to their miniserieslimited series category to accommodate anthology and other limited series23Event series largely considered a marketing term falling under the general category of event television The term can be applied to almost any new short-run series such as 24 Live Another Day It has also been used to describe game shows like The Million Second Quiz which aired for just two weeks22IndiaeditIn India the shows are particularly referred to as serials wherein the production is complex as well The shows usually amount to at least 200 episodes of 20 to25 minutes each On special episodes referred to as Maha-Episodes the duration last up to about 45 to 50 minutes The show airs till the TRP television rating point is a little less than decent The rating points depend on various criteria Usually shows which fail to attract TRP for a long time are shut downUK Ireland and Australia usageeditIn the United Kingdom and other countries these sets of episodes are referred to as a series In Australia the broadcasting may be different from North American usage The terms series and season are both used and are the same For example Battlestar Galactica has an original series as well as a remake both are considered a different series each with their own number of individual seasonsAustralian television does not follow seasons in the way that US television does for example there is no fall season or fall schedule For many years popular night-time dramas in Australia would run for much of the year and would only go into recess during the summer period December to February as Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere when ratings are not taken Therefore popular dramas would usually run from February through November each year This schedule was used in the 1970s for popular dramas including Number96 Many drama series such as McLeods Daughters have received between 22 and 32 episodes per season Typically soap operas which have always run in season format in Australia such as Home and Away would usually begin a new season in late January while the season finale would air in late November as the show is off air for two months or sometimes longer depending on the schedule In recent years a new season would begin in early February and the season finale would broadcast in early December Since Home and Aways inception it normally receives 230 episodes per season Some seasons have seen between 205 and 235 episodes commissioned During the Olympics Home and Away would often go on hiatus which was referred to as an Olympic cliffhanger Therefore the number of episodes would decrease Australian situation comedy series seasons are approximately 13 episodes long and premiere any time between February and NovemberBritish shows have tended toward shorter series in recent years For example the first series of long-running science fiction show Doctor Who in 1963 featured forty-two 25minute episodes this dropped to twenty-five by 1970 to accommodate changes in production and continued to 1984 For 1985 fewer but longer episodes were shown but even after a return to shorter episodes in 1986 lack of support within the BBC meant fewer episodes were commissioned leading to only fourteen 25minute episodes up to those in 1989 after which it was cancelled The revival of Doctor Who from 2005 has comprised thirteen 45minute installments There are some series in the UK that have a larger number of episodes for example Waterloo Road started with 8 to 12 episodes but from series three onward it increased to twenty episodes and series seven will contain 30 episodes Recently American non-cable networks have also begun to experiment with shorter series for some programs particularly reality shows such as Survivor They often air two series per year resulting in roughly the same number of episodes per year as a dramaThis is a reduction from the 1950s in which many American shows eg Gunsmoke had between 29 and 39 episodes per season Actual storytelling time within a commercial television hour has also gradually reduced over the years from 50 minutes out of every 60 to the current 44 and even less on some networks beginning in the early 21st centuryThe usage of season and series differ for DVD and Blu-ray releases in both Australia and the UK In Australia many locally produced shows are termed differently on home video releases For example a set of the television drama series Packed to the Rafters or Wentworth is referred to as season The Complete First Season etc whereas drama series such as Tangle are known as a series Series 1 etc British-produced shows such as Mrs Browns Boys are referred to as season in Australia for the DVD and Blu-ray releasesIn the UK and Ireland most programmes are referred to as series while season is starting to be used for some American and international releasesRunning timeeditThis section needs additional
