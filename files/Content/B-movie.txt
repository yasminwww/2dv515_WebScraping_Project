low-budget commercial motion picture that is not an arthouse film In its original usage during the Golden Age of Hollywood the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less-publicized bottom half of a double feature akin to B-sides for recorded music Although the US production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the end of the 1950s the term B movie continues to be used in its broader sense to this day In its post-Golden Age usage there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition on the one hand the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient on the other many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuityIn either usage most B movies represent a particular genrethe Western was a Golden Age B movie staple while low-budget science-fiction and horror films became more popular in the 1950s Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character Almost always shorter than the top-billed feature films1 many had running times of 70 minutes or less The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more lavishly budgeted headliners individual B films were often ignored by criticsLatter-day B movies still sometimes inspire multiple sequels but series are less common As the average running time of top-of-the-line films increased so did that of B pictures In its current usage the term has somewhat contradictory connotations it may signal an opinion that a certain movie is a a genre film with minimal artistic ambitions or b a lively energetic film uninhibited by the constraints imposed on more expensive projects and unburdened by the conventions of putatively serious independent film The term is also now used loosely to refer to some higher-budget mainstream films with exploitation-style content usually in genres traditionally associated with the B movieFrom their beginnings to the present day B movies have provided opportunities both for those coming up in the profession and others whose careers are waning Celebrated filmmakers such as Anthony Mann and Jonathan Demme learned their craft in B movies They are where actors such as John Wayne and Jack Nicholson first became established and they have provided work for former A movie actors such as Vincent Price and Karen Black Some actors such as Bela Lugosi Eddie Constantine Bruce Campbell and Pam Grier worked in B movies for most of their careers The term B actor is sometimes used to refer to a performer who finds work primarily or exclusively in B picturesContents1 History11 Golden Age of Hollywood111 1930s112 1940s12 Transition in the 1950s13 Golden age of exploitation131 1960s132 1970s14 Decline141 1980s142 1990s15 Transition

Thing 1928 was made for less than 20000 Soon director Frank Capras association with Columbia helped vault the studio toward Hollywoods major leagues2In 192728 at the end of the silent era the production cost of an average feature from a major Hollywood studio ranged from 190000 at Fox to 275000 at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer That average reflected both specials that might cost as much as 1 million and films made quickly for around 50000 These cheaper films not yet called B movies allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studios more important productions while also breaking in new personnel3 Studios in the minor leagues of the industry such as Columbia Pictures and Film Booking Offices of America FBO focused on exactly those sorts of cheap productions Their movies with relatively short running times targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs particularly small-town and urban neighborhood venues or nabes Even smaller production houses known as Poverty Row studios made films whose costs might run as low as 3000 seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns4With the widespread arrival of sound film in American theaters in 1929 many independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model which involved live acts and a broad variety of shorts before a single featured film A new programming scheme developed that soon became standard practice a newsreel a short andor serial and a cartoon followed by a double feature The second feature which actually screened before the main event cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in shorts The majors clearance rules favoring their affiliated theaters prevented the independents timely access to top-quality films the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead5 The additional movie also gave the program balancethe practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill The low-budget picture of the 1920s thus evolved into the second feature the B movie of Hollywoods Golden Age6Golden Age of HollywoodeditMain article B movies Hollywood Golden Age1930seditThe major studios at first resistant to the double feature soon adapted All established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market Block booking became standard practice to get access to a studios attractive A pictures many theaters were obliged to rent the companys entire output for a season With the B films rented at a flat fee rather than the box office percentage basis of A films rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the profitability of every B movie The parallel practice of blind bidding largely freed the majors from worrying about their Bs qualityeven when booking in less than seasonal blocks exhibitors had to buy

belonged to companies with sizable theater chains further securing the bottom line7Poverty Row studios from modest outfits like Mascot Pictures Tiffany Pictures and Sono Art-World Wide Pictures down to shoestring operations made exclusively B movies serials and other shorts and also distributed totally independent productions and imported films In no position to directly block book they mostly sold regional distribution exclusivity to states rights firms which in turn peddled blocks of movies to exhibitors typically six or more pictures featuring the same star a relative status on Poverty Row8 Two major-minorsUniversal Studios and rising Columbia Pictureshad production lines roughly similar to though somewhat better endowed than the top Poverty Row studios In contrast to the Big Five majors Universal and Columbia had few or no theaters though they did have top-rank film distribution exchanges9In the standard Golden Age model the industrys top product the A films premiered at a small number of select first-run houses in major cities Double features were not the rule at these prestigious venues As described by Edward Jay Epstein During these first runs films got their reviews garnered publicity and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising10 Then it was off to the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed At the larger local venues controlled by the majors movies might turn over on a weekly basis At the thousands of smaller independent theaters programs often changed two or three times a week To meet the constant demand for new B product the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long these were known as quickies for their tight production schedulesas short as four days11 As Brian Taves describes Many of the poorest theaters such as the grind houses in the larger cities screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily12 Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course for an A picture along with the trailers or screen previews that presaged its arrival the new films title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got writes Epstein13 Aside from at the theater itself B films might not be advertised at allThe introduction of sound had driven costs higher by 1930 the average US feature film cost 375000 to produce14 A broad range of motion pictures occupied the B category The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films but also movies classifiable as programmers also known as in-betweeners or intermediates As Taves describes Depending on the prestige of the theater and the other material on the double bill a programmer could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee15 On Poverty Row many Bs were made on budgets that would have barely covered petty cash on a majors A film with costs at the bottom of the industry running as low as 500011 By the mid-1930s the double feature was the dominant US exhibition model and the majors responded In 1935 B movie production at Warner Bros was raised from 12 to 50 of studio output The unit was headed by Bryan Foy known as the Keeper of the Bs16 At Fox which also shifted half of its production line into B territory Sol M Wurtzel was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s17  Stony Brooke Wayne Tucson Smith Corrigan and Lullaby Joslin Terhune did not get much time in

create Monogram Pictures early in the decade In 1935 Monogram Mascot and several smaller studios merged to establish Republic Pictures The former heads of Monogram soon sold off their Republic shares and set up a new Monogram production house18 Into the 1950s most Republic and Monogram product was roughly on par with the low end of the majors output Less sturdy Poverty Row concernswith a penchant for grand sobriquets like Conquest Empire Imperial and Peerlesscontinued to churn out dirt-cheap quickies19 Joel Finler has analyzed the average length of feature releases in 1938 indicating the

many Poverty Row firms approximately 75 of Hollywood movies from the decade more than four thousand pictures are classifiable as Bs22The Western was by far the predominant B genre in both the 1930s and to a lesser degree the 1940s23 Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that the B product of the Thirtiesthe Universal films with Tom Mix Ken Maynard and Buck Jones the Columbia features with Buck Jones and Tim McCoy the RKO George OBrien series the Republic Westerns with John Wayne and the Three Mesquiteers  achieved a uniquely American perfection of the well-made story24 At the far end of the industry Poverty Rows Ajax put out oaters starring Harry Carey then in his fifties The Weiss outfit had the Range Rider series the American Rough Rider series and the Morton of the Mounted northwest action thrillers25 One low-budget oater of the era made totally outside the studio system profited from an outrageous concept a Western with an all-midget cast The Terror of Tiny Town 1938 was such a success in its independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution26Series of various genres featuring recurrent title-worthy characters or name actors in familiar roles were particularly popular during the first decade of sound film Foxs many B series for instance included Charlie Chan mysteries Ritz Brothers comedies and musicals with child star Jane Withers27 These series films are not to be confused with the short cliffhanger-structured serials that sometimes appeared on the same program As with serials however many series were intended to attract young peoplea theater that twin-billed part-time might run a balanced or entirely youth-oriented double feature as a matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night In the words of one industry report afternoon moviegoers composed largely of housewives and children want quantity for their money while the evening crowds want something good and not too much of it28 Series films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B movie category but even here there is ambiguity at MGM for example popular series like the Andy Hardy and the Dr KildareDr Gillespie chronicles had leading stars and budgets that would have been A-level at most of the lesser studios29 For many series even a lesser majors standard B budget was far out of reach Poverty Rows Consolidated Pictures featured Tarzan the Police Dog in a series with the proud name of Melodramatic Dog Features301940seditBy 1940 the average production cost of an American feature was 400000 a negligible increase over ten years14 A number of small Hollywood companies had folded around the turn of the decade including the ambitious Grand National but a new firm Producers Releasing Corporation PRC emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram The double feature never universal was still the prevailing exhibition model in 1941 fifty percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively and others employed the policy part-time31 In the early 1940s legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures Restrictions were also placed on the majors ability to enforce blind bidding32 These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production making the smaller studios even more important as B movie suppliers Genre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row with even Republics and Monograms budgets rarely climbing over 200000 Many smaller Poverty Row firms folded as the eight majors with their proprietary distribution exchanges now commanded about 95 of US and Canadian box office receipts33 In 1946 independent producer David O Selznick brought his bloated-budget spectacle Duel in the Sun to market with heavy nationwide promotion and wide release The distribution strategy was a major success despite what was widely perceived as the movies poor quality34 The Duel release anticipated practices that fueled the B movie industry in the late 1950s when the top Hollywood studios made them standard two decades after that the B movie was hard hit35Considerations beside cost made the line between A and B movies ambiguous Films shot on B-level budgets were occasionally marketed as A pictures or emerged as sleeper hits one of 1943s biggest films was Hitlers Children an RKO thriller made for a fraction over 200000 It earned more than 3 million in rentals industry language for a distributors share of gross box office receipts36 Particularly in the realm of film noir A pictures sometimes echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films Programmers with their flexible exhibition role were ambiguous by definition As late as 1948 the double feature remained a popular exhibition modeit was standard policy at 25 of theaters and used part-time at an additional 3637 The leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope in 1947 Monogram established a subsidiary Allied Artists to develop and distribute relatively expensive films mostly from independent producers Around the same time Republic launched a similar effort under the Premiere rubric38 In 1947 as well PRC was subsumed by Eagle-Lion a British company seeking entry to the American market Warners former Keeper of the Bs Brian Foy was installed as production chief39  Often marketed as pure sensationalism many films noir also possessed great visual beauty Raw Deal 1948 writes scholar Robert Smith is resplendent with velvety blacks mists netting and other expressive accessories of poetic noir decor and lighting40 Directed by Anthony Mann and shot by John Alton it was released by Poverty Rows Eagle-Lion firmIn the 1940s RKO stood out among the industrys Big Five for its focus on B pictures41 From a latter-day perspective the most famous of the major studios Golden Age B units is Val Lewtons horror unit at RKO Lewton produced such moody mysterious films as Cat People 1942 I Walked with a Zombie 1943 and The Body Snatcher 1945 directed by Jacques Tourneur Robert Wise and others who became renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect42 The movie now widely described as the first classic film noirStranger on the Third Floor 1940 a 64-minute Bwas produced at RKO which released many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein43 The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s Though many of the best-known film noirs were A-level productions most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill In the decades since these cheap entertainments generally dismissed at the time have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywoods Golden Age44In one sample year 1947 RKO produced along with several noir programmers and A pictures two straight B noirs Desperate and The Devil Thumbs a Ride45 Ten B noirs that year came from Poverty Rows big threeRepublic Monogram and PRCEagle-Lionand one came from tiny Screen Guild Three majors beside RKO contributed a total of five more Along with these eighteen unambiguous B noirs an additional dozen or so noir programmers came out of Hollywood46 Still most of the majors low-budget production remained the sort now largely ignored RKOs representative output included the Mexican Spitfire and Lum and Abner comedy series thrillers featuring the Saint and the Falcon Westerns starring Tim Holt and Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller Jean Hersholt played Dr Christian in six films between 1939 and 194147 The Courageous Dr Christian 1940 was a standard entry In the course of an hour or so of screen time the saintly physician managed to cure an epidemic of spinal meningitis demonstrate benevolence towards the disenfranchised set an example for wayward youth and calm the passions of an amorous old maid48Down in Poverty Row low budgets led to less palliative fare Republic aspired to major-league respectability while making many cheap and modestly budgeted Westerns but there was not much from the bigger studios that compared with Monogram exploitation pictures like juvenile delinquency expos Where Are Your Children 1943 and the prison film Women in Bondage 194349 In 1947 PRCs The Devil on Wheels brought together teenagers hot rods and death The little studio had its own house auteur with his own crew and relatively free rein director Edgar G Ulmer was known as the Capra of PRC50 Ulmer made films of every generic stripe his Girls in Chains was released in May 1943 six months before Women in Bondage by the end of the year Ulmer had also made the teen-themed musical Jive Junction as well as Isle of Forgotten Sins a South Seas adventure set around a brothel51Transition in the 1950seditMain article B movies in the 1950sIn 1948 a Supreme Court ruling in a federal antitrust suit against the majors outlawed block booking and led to the Big Five divesting their theater chains With audiences draining away to television and studios scaling back production schedules the classic double feature vanished from many American theaters during the 1950s The major studios promoted the benefits of recycling offering former headlining movies as second features in the place of traditional B films52 With television airing many classic Westerns as well as producing its own original Western series the cinematic market for B oaters in particular was drying up After barely inching forward in the 1930s the average US feature production cost had essentially doubled over the 1940s reaching 1 million by the turn of the decadea 93 rise after adjusting for inflation14The first prominent victim of the changing market was Eagle-Lion which released its last films in 1951 By 1953 the old Monogram brand had disappeared the company having adopted the identity of its higher-end subsidiary Allied Artists The following year Allied released Hollywoods last B series Westerns Non-series B Westerns continued to appear for a few more years but Republic Pictures long associated with cheap sagebrush sagas was out of the filmmaking business by decades end In other genres Universal kept its Ma and Pa Kettle series going through 1957 while Allied Artists stuck with the Bowery Boys until 195853 RKO weakened by years of mismanagement exited the movie industry in 195754 Hollywoods A product was getting longerthe top ten box-office releases of 1940 had averaged 1125 minutes the average length of 1955s top ten was 123455 In their modest way the Bs were following suit The age of the hour-long feature film was past 70 minutes was now roughly the minimum While the Golden Age-style second feature was dying B movie was still used to refer to any low-budget genre film featuring relatively unheralded performers sometimes referred to as B actors The term retained its earlier suggestion that such movies relied on formulaic plots stock character types and simplistic action or unsophisticated comedy56 At the same time the realm of the B movie was becoming increasingly fertile territory for experimentation both serious and outlandishIda Lupino a leading actress established herself as Hollywoods sole female director of the era57 In short low-budget pictures made for her production company The Filmakers Lupino explored virtually taboo subjects such as rape in 1950s Outrage and 1953s self-explanatory The Bigamist58 Her best known directorial effort The Hitch-Hiker a 1953 RKO release is the only film noir from the genres classic period directed by a woman59 That year RKO released Split Second which concludes in a nuclear test range and is perhaps the first atomic noir60 The most famous such movie the independently produced Kiss Me Deadly 1955 typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and B picture as Richard Maltby describes a programmer capable of occupying either half of a neighbourhood theatres double-bill it was budgeted at approximately 400000 Its distributor United Artists released around twenty-five programmers with production budgets between 100000 and 400000 in 195561 The films length 106 minutes is A level but its star Ralph Meeker had previously appeared in only one major film Its source is pure pulp one of Mickey Spillanes Mike Hammer novels but Robert Aldrichs direction is self-consciously aestheticized The result is a brutal genre picture that also evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of simply as the Bomb62  Rocketship X-M 1950 produced and released by small Lippert Pictures is cited as possibly the first postnuclear holocaust film63 It was at the leading edge of a large cycle of movies mostly low-budget and many long forgotten classifiable as atomic bomb cinemaThe fear of nuclear war with the Soviet Union along with less expressible qualms about radioactive fallout from Americas own atomic tests energized many of the eras genre films Science fiction horror and various hybrids of the two were now of central economic importance to the low-budget end of the business Most down-market films of the typelike many of those produced by William Alland at Universal such as Creature from the Black Lagoon 1954 and Sam Katzman at Columbia including It Came from Beneath the Sea 1955provided little more than thrills though their special effects could be impressive64 But these were genres whose fantastic nature could also be used as cover for mordant cultural observations often difficult to make in mainstream movies Director Don Siegels Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956 released by Allied Artists treats conformist pressures and the evil of banality in haunting allegorical fashion65 The Amazing Colossal Man 1957 directed by Bert I Gordon is both a monster movie that happens to depict the horrific effects of radiation exposure and a ferocious cold-war fable that spins Korea the armys obsessive secrecy and Americas post-war growth into one fantastic whole66The Amazing Colossal Man was released by a new company whose name was much bigger than its budgets American International Pictures AIP founded in 1956 by James H Nicholson and Samuel Z Arkoff in a reorganization of their American Releasing Corporation ARC soon became the leading US studio devoted entirely to B-cost productions67 American International helped keep the original-release double bill alive through paired packages of its films these movies were low-budget but instead of a flat rate they were rented out on a percentage basis like A films68 The success of I Was a Teenage Werewolf 1957 thus brought AIP a large returnmade for about 100000 it grossed more than 2 million69 As the films title suggests the studio relied on both fantastic genre subjects and new teen-oriented angles When Hot Rod Gang 1958 turned a profit hot rod horror was given a try Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow 1959 David Cook credits AIP with leading the way in demographic exploitation target marketing and saturation booking all of which became standard procedure for the majors in planning and releasing their mass-market event films by the late 1970s70 In terms of content the majors were already there with films about juvenile delinquency such as Warner Bros Untamed Youth 1957 and MGMs High School Confidential 1958 both starring Mamie Van Doren71In 1954 a young filmmaker named Roger Corman received his first screen credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists Highway Dragnet Corman soon independently produced his first movie Monster from the Ocean Floor on a 12000 budget and a six-day shooting schedule72 Among the six films he worked on in 1955 Corman produced and directed the first official ARC release Apache Woman and Day the World Ended half of Arkoff and Nicholsons first twin-bill package Corman directed over fifty feature films through 1990 As of 2007 he remained active as a producer with more than 350 movies to his credit Often referred to as the King of the Bs Corman has said that to my way of thinking I never made a B movie in my life as the traditional B movie was dying out when he began making pictures He prefers to describe his metier as low-budget exploitation films73 In later years Corman both with AIP and as head of his own companies helped launch the careers of Francis Ford Coppola Jonathan Demme Robert Towne and Robert De Niro among many others74In the late 1950s William Castle became known as the great innovator of the B movie publicity gimmick Audiences of Macabre 1958 an 86000 production distributed by Allied Artists were invited to take out insurance policies to cover potential death from fright The 1959 creature feature The Tingler featured Castles most famous gimmick Percepto at the films climax buzzers attached to select theater seats unexpectedly rattled a few audience members prompting either appropriate screams or even more appropriate laughter75 With such films Castle combined the saturation advertising campaign perfected by Columbia and Universal in their Sam Katzman and William Alland packages with centralized and standardized publicity stunts and gimmicks that had previously been the purview of the local exhibitor76The postwar drive-in theater boom was vital to the expanding independent B movie industry In January 1945 there were 96 drive-ins in the United States a decade later there were more than 370077 Unpretentious pictures with simple familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing with all its attendant distractions The phenomenon of the drive-in movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s At the same time many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots popularizing the notion of the midnight movie78Increasingly American-made genre films were joined by foreign movies acquired at low cost and where necessary dubbed for the US market In 1956 distributor Joseph E Levine financed the shooting of new footage with American actor Raymond Burr that was edited into the Japanese sci-fi horror film Godzilla79 The British Hammer Film Productions made the successful The Curse of Frankenstein 1957 and Dracula 1958 major influences on future horror film style In 1959 Levines Embassy Pictures bought the worldwide rights to Hercules a cheaply made Italian movie starring American-born bodybuilder Steve Reeves On top of a 125000 purchase price Levine then spent 15 million on advertising and publicity a virtually unprecedented amount80 The New York Times was not impressed claiming that the movie would have drawn little more than yawns in the film market had it not been launched throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity81 Levine counted on first-weekend box office for his profits booking the film into as many cinemas as he could for a weeks run then withdrawing it before poor word-of-mouth withdrew it for him82 Hercules opened at a remarkable 600 theaters and the strategy was a smashing success the film earned 47 million in domestic rentals Just as valuable to the bottom line it was even more successful overseas80 Within a few decades Hollywood was dominated by both movies and an exploitation philosophy very much like LevinesGolden age of exploitationedit1960seditMain articles B movies exploitation boom and Midnight movieDespite all the transformations in the industry by 1961 the average production cost of an American feature film was still only 2 millionafter adjusting for inflation less than 10 more than it had been in 195014 The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters The AIP-style dual genre package was the new model In July 1960 the latest Joseph E Levine sword-and-sandals import Hercules Unchained opened at neighborhood theaters in New York A suspense film Terror Is a Man ran as a co-feature with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick The dnouement helpfully includes a warning bell so the sensitive can close their eyes83 That year Roger Corman took AIP down a new road When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color84 The resulting House of Usher typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification It was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed But it is generally seen as a B movie the schedule was still a mere fifteen days the budget just 200000 one tenth the industry average85 and its 85-minute running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes86With the loosening of industry censorship constraints the 1960s saw a major expansion in the commercial viability of a variety of B movie subgenres that became known collectively as exploitation films The combination of intensive and gimmick-laden publicity with movies featuring vulgar subject matter and often outrageous imagery dated back decadesthe term had originally defined truly fringe productions made at the lowest depths of Poverty Row or entirely outside the Hollywood system Many graphically depicted the wages of sin in the context of promoting prudent lifestyle choices particularly sexual hygiene Audiences might see explicit footage of anything from a live birth to a ritual circumcision87 Such films were not generally booked as part of movie theaters regular schedules but rather presented as special events by traveling roadshow promoters they might also appear as fodder for grindhouses which typically had no regular schedule at all The most famous of those promoters Kroger Babb was in the vanguard of marketing low-budget sensationalistic films with a 100 saturation campaign inundating the target audience with ads in almost any imaginable medium88 In the era of the traditional double feature no one would have characterized these graphic exploitation films as B movies With the majors having exited traditional B production and exploitation-style promotion becoming standard practice at the lower end of the industry exploitation became a way to refer to the entire field of low-budget genre films89 The 1960s saw exploitation-style themes and imagery become increasingly central to the realm of the B  Motorpsycho 1965 was not hard to market It had director Russ Meyers reputation for eroticism the biker theme MURDERcycles that soon proved its popularity in historic fashion and that trendy title wordpsychoExploitation movies in the original sense continued to appear 1961s Damaged Goods a cautionary tale about a young lady whose boyfriends promiscuity leads to venereal disease comes complete with enormous grotesque closeups of VDs physical effects90 At the same time the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a related similarly venerable tradition nudie films featuring nudist-camp footage or striptease artists like Bettie Page had simply been the softcore pornography of previous decades As far back as 1933 This Nude World was Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced91 In the late 1950s as more of the old grindhouse theaters devoted themselves specifically to adult product a few filmmakers began making nudies with greater attention to plot Best known was Russ Meyer who released his first successful narrative nudie the comic Immoral Mr Teas in 1959 Five years later Meyer came out with his breakthrough film Lorna which combined sex violence and a dramatic storyline92 Faster Pussycat Kill Kill 1965 made for about 45000 ultimately became the most famous of Meyers sexploitation pictures Crafted for constant titillation but containing no nudity it was aimed at the same passion pit drive-in circuit that screened AIP teen movies with wink-wink titles like Beach Blanket Bingo 1965 and How to Stuff a Wild Bikini 1966 starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon93 Roger Cormans The Trip 1967 for American International written by veteran AIPCorman actor Jack Nicholson never shows a fully bared unpainted breast but flirts with nudity throughout94 The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing closerOne of the most influential films of the era on Bs and beyond was Paramounts Psycho Its 85 million in earnings against a production cost of 800000 made it the most profitable movie of 196095 Its mainstream distribution without the Production Code seal of approval helped weaken US film censorship And as William Paul notes this move into the horror genre by respected director Alfred Hitchcock was made significantly with the lowest-budgeted film of his American career and the least glamorous stars Its greatest initial impact was on schlock horror movies notably those from second-tier director William Castle each of which tried to bill itself as scarier than Psycho96 Castles first film in the Psycho vein was Homicidal 1961 an early step in the development of the slasher subgenre that took off in the late 1970s95 Blood Feast 1963 a movie about human dismemberment and culinary preparation made for approximately 24000 by experienced nudie-maker Herschell Gordon Lewis established a new more immediately successful subgenre the gore or splatter film Lewiss business partner David F Friedman drummed up publicity by distributing vomit bags to theatergoersthe sort of gimmick Castle had masteredand arranging for an injunction against the film in Sarasota Floridathe sort of problem exploitation films had long run up against except Friedman had planned it97 This new breed of gross-out movie typified the emerging sense of exploitationthe progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie elements into horror into other classic B genres and into the low-budget film industry as a whole Imports of Hammer Films increasingly explicit horror movies and Italian gialli highly stylized pictures mixing sexploitation and ultraviolence fueled this trend98The Production Code was officially scrapped in 1968 to be replaced by the first version of the modern rating system99 That year two horror films came out that heralded directions American cinema would take in the next decade with major consequences for the B movie One was a high-budget Paramount production directed by the celebrated Roman Polanski Produced by B horror veteran William Castle Rosemarys Baby was the first upscale Hollywood picture in the genre in three decades100 It was a critical success and the years seventh-biggest hit101 The other was George A Romeros Night of the Living Dead produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for 114000 Building on the achievement of B genre predecessors like Invasion of the Body Snatchers in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues it doubled as a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for both the Vietnam War and domestic racial conflicts Its greatest influence though derived from its clever subversion of genre clichs and the connection made between its exploitation-style imagery low-cost truly independent means of production and high profitability102 With the Code gone and the X rating established major studio A films like Midnight Cowboy could now show adult imagery while the market for increasingly hardcore pornography exploded In this transformed commercial context work like Russ Meyers gained a new legitimacy In 1969 for the first time a Meyer film Finders Keepers Lovers Weepers was reviewed in The New York Times103 Soon Corman was creating nudity-filled sexploitation pictures such as Private Duty Nurses 1971 and Women in Cages 1971104In May 1969 the most important exploitation movie of the era premiered at the Cannes Film Festival105 Much of Easy Riders significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable if still modest budget and released by a major studio The project was first taken by one of its cocreators Peter Fonda to American International Fonda had become AIPs top star in the Corman-directed The Wild Angels 1966 a biker movie and The Trip as in taking LSD The idea Fonda pitched combined those two proven themes AIP was intrigued but balked at giving his collaborator Dennis Hopper also a studio alumnus free directorial rein Eventually they arranged a financing and distribution deal with Columbia as two more graduates of the CormanAIP exploitation mill joined the project Jack Nicholson and cinematographer Lszl Kovcs106 The film which incorporated another favorite exploitation theme the redneck menace as well as a fair amount of nudity was brought in at a cost of 501000 It earned 191 million in rentals107 In the words of historians Seth Cagin and Philip Dray Easy Rider became the seminal film that provided the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by schlockkitschhack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of the seventies1081970seditIn the late 1960s and early 1970s a new generation of low-budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s Operations such as Roger Cormans New World Pictures Cannon Films and New Line Cinema brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country The major studios top product was continuing to inflate in running timein 1970 the ten biggest earners averaged 1401 minutes109 The Bs were keeping pace In 1955 Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 748 minutes He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970 two for AIP and three for his own New World the average length was 898 minutes110 These films could turn a tidy profit The first New World release the biker movie Angels Die Hard cost 117000 to produce and took in more than 2 million at the box office111The biggest studio in the low-budget field remained a leader in exploitations growth In 1973 American International gave a shot to young director Brian De Palma Reviewing Sisters Pauline Kael observed that its limp technique doesnt seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore He cant get two people talking in order to make a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938112 Many examples of the blaxploitation genre featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs violent crime and prostitution were the product of AIP One of blaxploitations biggest stars was Pam Grier who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyers Beyond the Valley of the Dolls 1970 Several New World pictures followed including The Big Doll House 1971 and The Big Bird Cage 1972 both directed by Jack Hill Hill also directed her best-known performances in two AIP blaxploitation films Coffy 1973 and Foxy Brown 1974113Blaxploitation was the first exploitation genre in which the major studios were central Indeed the United Artists release Cotton Comes to Harlem 1970 directed by Ossie Davis is seen as the first significant film of the type114 But the movie that truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was completely independent Sweet Sweetbacks Baadasssss Song 1971 is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form wildly experimental borderline pornographic and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution115 Melvin Van Peebles wrote co-produced directed starred in edited and composed the music for the film which was completed with a loan from Bill Cosby116 Its distributor was small Cinemation Industries then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian Mondo Cane shockumentaries and the Swedish skin flick Fanny Hill as well as for its one in-house production The Man from ORGY 1970117 These sorts of films played in the grindhouses of the daymany of them not outright porno theaters but rather venues for all manner of exploitation cinema The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone but a continuity of spirit was evident118  Piranha 1978 directed by Joe Dante and written by John Sayles for Cormans New World Pictures is an action-filled creature feature an environmentalist cautionary tale and a humorous parody of Jaws It was one of many exploitation films to mimic the design of Jaws famous poster with its promise of titillating thrills119In 1970 a low-budget crime drama shot in 16mm by first-time American director Barbara Loden won the international critics prize at the Venice Film Festival120 Wanda is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture The crime-based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old-school B noir The 115000 production120 for which Loden spent six years raising money was praised by Vincent Canby for the absolute accuracy of its effects the decency of its point of view and purity of technique121 Like Romero and Van Peebles other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary The first three features directed by Larry Cohen Bone 1972 Black Caesar 1973 and Hell Up in Harlem 1973 were all nominally blaxploitation movies but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism122 The gory horror film Deathdream 1974 directed by Bob Clark is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam123 Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential Shivers 1975 Rabid 1977 The Brood 1979124 An Easy Rider with conceptual rigor the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists biker-themed Electra Glide in Blue 1973 directed by James William Guercio125 The New York Times reviewer thought little of it Under different intentions it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike moviethough Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio126In the early 1970s the growing practice of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows with the goal of building a cult film audience brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema now in a countercultural settingsomething like a drive-in movie for the hip127 One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system like John Waters Pink Flamingos 1972 with its campy spin on exploitation spurred the development of the independent film movement128 The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975 an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichs became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial unprofitable release Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie129Asian martial arts films began appearing as imports regularly during the 1970s These kung fu films as they were often called whatever martial art they featured were popularized in the United States by the Hong Kongproduced movies of Bruce Lee and marketed to the same audience targeted by AIP and New World130 Horror continued to attract young independent American directors As Roger Ebert explained in one 1974 review Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if theyre brought in at the right price So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who cant get more conventional projects off the ground131 The movie under consideration was The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Made by Tobe Hooper for less than 300000 it became one of the most influential horror films of the 1970s132 John Carpenters Halloween 1978 produced on a 320000 budget grossed over 80 million worldwide and effectively established the slasher flick as horrors primary mode for the next decade Just as Hooper had learned from Romeros work Halloween in turn largely followed the model of Black Christmas 1974 directed by Deathdreams Bob Clark133On television the parallels between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear134 In the 1970s original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well As production of TV movies expanded with the introduction of the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969 soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory Television films inspired by recent scandalssuch as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979harkened all the way back to the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes135 Many 1970s TV filmssuch as The California Kid 1974 starring Martin Sheenwere action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production Nightmare in Badham County 1976 headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation136The reverberations of Easy Rider could be felt in such pictures as well as in a host of theatrical exploitation films But its greatest influence on the fate of the B movie was less directby 1973 the major studios were catching on to the commercial potential of genres once largely consigned to the bargain basement Rosemarys Baby had been a big hit but it had little in common with the exploitation style Warner Bros The Exorcist demonstrated that a heavily promoted horror film could be an absolute blockbuster it was the biggest movie of the year and by far the highest-earning horror movie yet made In William Pauls description it is also the film that really established gross-out as a mode of expression for mainstream cinema Past exploitation films managed to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their marginality The Exorcist made cruelty respectable By the end of the decade the exploitation booking strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters became standard industry practice137 Writer-director George Lucass American Graffiti a Universal production did something similar Described by Paul as essentially an American-International teenybopper pic with a lot more spit and polish it was 1973s third-biggest film and likewise by far the highest-earning teen-themed movie yet made138 Even more historically significant movies with B themes and A-level financial backing followed in their wakeDeclineeditMain article B movies since the 1980s1980seditMost of the B-movie production houses founded during the exploitation era collapsed or were subsumed by larger companies as the fields financial situation changed in the early 1980s Even a comparatively cheap efficiently made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of dollars as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of expensive genre movies raising audience expectations for spectacular action sequences and realistic special effects139 Intimations of the trend were evident as early as Airport 1970 and especially in the mega-schlock of The Poseidon Adventure 1972 Earthquake 1973 and The Towering Inferno 1974 Their disaster plots and dialogue were B-grade at best from an industry perspective however these were pictures firmly rooted in a tradition of star-stuffed extravaganzas The Exorcist had demonstrated the drawing power of big-budget effects-laden horror But the tidal shift in the majors focus owed largely to the enormous success of three films Steven Spielbergs creature feature Jaws 1975 and George Lucass space opera Star Wars 1977 had each in turn become the highest-grossing film in motion picture history Superman released in December 1978 had proved that a studio could spend 55 million on a movie about a childrens comic book character and turn a big profitit was the top box-office hit of 1978140 Blockbuster fantasy spectacles like the original 1933 King Kong had once been exceptional in the new Hollywood increasingly under the sway of multi-industrial conglomerates they ruled141  Too gory to be an art film too arty to be an exploitation film funny but not quite a comedy 168 private investors backed Blood Simples 15 million budget142 Brothers Joel and Ethan Coen brought a striking visual style to the 1984 noir In one repeated motif writes David Denby automobile headlights threaten people doing surreptitious things in the dark143It had taken a decade and a half from 1961 to 1976 for the production cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from 2 million to 4 milliona decline if adjusted for inflation In just four years it more than doubled again hitting 85 million in 1980 a constant-dollar increase of about 25 Even as the US inflation rate eased the average expense of moviemaking continued to soar144 With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit Double features were now literally historyalmost impossible to find except at revival houses One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists which declared bankruptcy in April 1979145 In the late 1970s AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979 The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980146Despite the mounting financial pressures distribution obstacles and overall risk many genre movies from small studios and independent filmmakers were still reaching theaters Horror was the strongest low-budget genre of the time particularly in the slasher mode as with The Slumber Party Massacre 1982 written by feminist author Rita Mae Brown The film was produced for New World on a budget of 250000147 At the beginning of 1983 Corman sold New World New Horizons later ConcordeNew Horizons became his primary company In 1984 New Horizons released a critically applauded movie set amid the punk scene written and directed by Penelope Spheeris The New York Times review concluded Suburbia is a good genre film148Larry Cohen continued to twist genre conventions in pictures such as Q aka Q The Winged Serpent 1982 described by critic Chris Petit as the kind of movie that used to be indispensable to the market an imaginative popular low-budget picture that makes the most of its limited resources and in which people get on with the job instead of standing around talking about it149 In 1981 New Line put out Polyester a John Waters movie with a small budget and an old-school exploitation gimmick Odorama That October The Book of the Dead a gore-filled yet stylish horror movie made for less than 400000 debuted in Detroit150 Its writer director and co-executive producer Sam Raimi was a week shy of his twenty-second birthday star and co-executive producer Bruce Campbell was twenty-three It was picked up for distribution by New Line retitled The Evil Dead and became a hit In the words of one newspaper critic it was a shoestring tour de force151One of the most successful 1980s B studios was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era Troma Pictures founded in 1974 Tromas most characteristic productions including Class of Nuke Em High 1986 Redneck Zombies 1986 and Surf Nazis Must Die 1987 take exploitation for an absurdist spin Tromas best-known production is The Toxic Avenger 1985 its hideous hero affectionately known as Toxie was featured in several sequels and a TV cartoon series152 One of the few successful B studio startups of the decade was Rome-based Empire Pictures whose first production Ghoulies reached theaters in 1985 The video rental market was becoming central to B film economics Empires financial model relied on seeing a profit not from theatrical rentals but only later at the video store153 A number of ConcordeNew Horizon releases went this route as well appearing only briefly in theaters if at all The growth of the cable television industry also helped support the low-budget film industry as many B movies quickly wound up as filler material for 24-hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose1541990seditBy 1990 the cost of the average US film had passed 25 million155 Of the nine films released that year to gross more than 100 million at the US box office two would have been strictly B-movie material before the late 1970s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dick Tracy Three morethe science-fiction thriller Total Recall the action-filled detective thriller Die Hard 2 and the years biggest hit the slapstick kiddie comedy Home Alonewere also far closer to the traditional arena of the Bs than to classic A-list subject matter156 The growing popularity of home video and access to unedited movies on cable and satellite television along with real estate pressures were making survival more difficult for the sort of small or non-chain theaters that were the primary home of independently produced genre films157 Drive-in screens were rapidly disappearing from the American landscape158Surviving B movie operations adapted in different ways Releases from Troma now frequently went straight to video New Line in its first decade had been almost exclusively a distributor of low-budget independent and foreign genre pictures With the smash success of exploitation veteran Wes Cravens original Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 whose nearly 2 million cost it had directly backed the company began moving steadily into higher-budget genre productions In 1994 New Line was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System it was soon being run as a midsized studio with a broad range of product alongside Warner Bros within the Time Warner conglomerate159 The following year Showtime launched Roger Corman Presents a series of thirteen straight-to-cable movies produced by ConcordeNew Horizons A New York Times reviewer found that the initial installment qualified as vintage Corman spiked with everything from bared female breasts to a mind-blowing quote from Thomas Manns Death in Venice160At the same time as exhibition venues for B films vanished the independent film movement was burgeoning among the results were various crossovers between the low-budget genre movie and the sophisticated arthouse picture Director Abel Ferrara who built a reputation with violent B movies such as The Driller Killer 1979 and Ms 45 1981 made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex drugs and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption King of New York 1990 was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of Bad Lieutenant 1992 18 million was financed totally independently161 Larry Fessendens micro-budget monster movies such as No Telling 1991 and Habit 1997 reframe classic genre subjectsFrankenstein and vampirism respectivelyto explore issues of contemporary relevance162 The budget of David Cronenbergs Crash 1996 10 million was not comfortably A-grade but it was hardly B-level either The films imagery was another matter On its scandalizing surface David Cronenbergs Crash suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick wrote critic Janet Maslin163 Financed like King of New York by a consortium of production companies it was picked up for US distribution by Fine Line Features This result mirrored the films scrambling of definitions Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line recently merged into the Time Warner empirespecifically it was the old exploitation distributors arthouse division164 Pulp Fiction 1994 directed by Quentin Tarantino on an 85 million budget became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple lines as James Mottram describes With its art house narrative structure B-movie subject matter and Hollywood cast the film is the axis for three distinct cinematic traditions to intersect165Transition in the 2000seditMain article B movies since the 1980sBy the turn of the millennium the average production cost of an American feature had already spent three years above the 50 million mark155 In 2005 the top ten movies at the US box office included three adaptations of childrens fantasy novels one extending and another initiating a series Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe respectively a child-targeted cartoon Madagascar a comic book adaptation Batman Begins a sci-fi series installment Star Wars Episode III  Revenge of the Sith a sci-fi remake War of the Worlds and a King Kong remake166 It was a slow year for Corman he produced just one movie which had no American theatrical release true of most of the pictures he had been involved in over the preceding decade167 As big-budget Hollywood movies further usurped traditional low-rent genres the ongoing viability of the familiar brand of B movie was in grave doubt New York Times critic A O Scott warned of the impending extinction of the cheesy campy guilty pleasures of the B picture168  B movies are not necessarily schlock Shane Carruth made the sophisticated science fiction film Primer 2004 for 7000 According to critic Adam Lemke Carruths cramped claustrophobic mise-en-scene exemplifies a subtle yet austere visual style that never succumbs to the restrictions of his limited budget169On the other hand recent industry trends suggest the reemergence of something like the traditional A-B split in major studio production though with fewer programmers bridging the gap According to a 2006 report by industry analyst Alfonso Marone The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around 60 m rising to 100 m when the cost of marketing for domestic launch USA only is factored into the equation However we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers large productions 120150 m and niche features 520m  Fewer 3070 m releases are expected170 Fox launched a new subsidiary in 2006 Fox Atomic to concentrate on teen-oriented genre films The economic model was deliberately low-rent at least by major studio standards According to a Variety report Fox Atomic is staying at or below the 10 million mark for many of its movies Its also encouraging filmmakers to shoot digitallya cheaper process that results in a grittier teen-friendly look And forget about stars Of Atomics nine announced films not one has a big name171 The newfangled B movie division was shut down in 2009172As the Variety report suggests recent technological advances greatly facilitate the production of truly low-budget motion pictures Although there have always been economical means with which to shoot movies including Super 8 and 16mm film as well as video cameras recording onto analog videotape these media could not rival the image quality of 35mm film The development of digital cameras and postproduction methods now allow even low-budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent and not necessarily grittier image quality and editing effects As Marone observes the equipment budget camera support required for shooting digital is approximately 110 that for film significantly lowering the production budget for independent features At the same time since the early 2000s the quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically170 Independent filmmakers whether working in a genre or arthouse mode continue to find it difficult to gain access to distribution channels though digital end-to-end methods of distribution offer new opportunities In a similar way Internet sites such as YouTube have opened up entirely new avenues for the presentation of low-budget motion pictures173Associated termseditThe terms C movie and the more common Z movie describe progressively lower grades of the B movie category The terms drive-in movie and midnight movie which emerged in association with specific historical phenomena are now often used as synonyms for B movieC movieeditThe C movie is the grade of motion picture at the low end of the B movie orin some taxonomiessimply below it174 In the 1980s with the growth of cable television the C grade began to be applied with increasing frequency to low-quality genre films used as filler programming for that market The C in the term then does double duty referring not only to quality that is lower than B but also to the initial c of cable Helping to popularize the notion of the C movie was the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000 198899 which ran on national cable channels first Comedy Central then the Sci Fi Channel after its first year Updating a concept introduced by TV hostess Vampira over three decades before MST3K presented cheap low-grade movies primarily science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s along with running voiceover commentary highlighting the films shortcomings Director Ed Wood has been called the master of the C-movie in this sense although Z movie see below is perhaps even more applicable to his work175 The rapid expansion of niche cable and satellite outlets such as Sci Fi with its Sci Fi Pictures and HBOs genre channels in the 1990s and 2000s has meant a market for contemporary C pictures many of them direct to cable moviessmall-budget genre films never released in theaters176Z movieeditMain article Z movie  Often called the worst film ever made Ed Woods ultra-low-budget Plan 9 from Outer Space 1959 has become the most famous of all Z moviesThe term Z movie or grade-Z movie is used by some to characterize low-budget pictures with quality standards well below those of most B and even C movies Most films referred to as Z movies are made on very small budgets by operations on the fringes of the commercial film industry The micro-budget quickies of 1930s fly-by-night Poverty Row production houses may be thought of as Z movies avant la lettre177 The films of director Ed Wood such as Glen or Glenda 1953 and Plan 9 from Outer Space 1959the latter frequently cited as one of the worst pictures ever madeexemplify the classic grade-Z movie Latter-day Zs are often characterized by violent gory or sexual content and a minimum of artistic interest much of which is destined for the subscription TV equivalent of the grindhouse178Psychotronic movieeditPsychotronic movie is a term coined by film critic Michael J Weldonreferred to by a fellow critic as the historian of marginal moviesto denote the sort of low-budget genre pictures that are generally disdained or ignored entirely by the critical establishment179 Weldons immediate source for the term was the Chicago cult film The Psychotronic Man 1980 whose title character is a barber who develops the ability to kill using psychic energy According to Weldon My original idea with that word is that its a two-part word Psycho stands for the horror movies and tronic stands for the science fiction movies I very quickly expanded the meaning of the word to include any kind of exploitation or B-movie180 The term popularized beginning in the 1980s with publications of Weldons such as The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film The Psychotronic Video Guide and Psychotronic Video magazine has subsequently been adopted by other critics and fans Use of the term tends to emphasize a focus on and affection for those B movies that lend themselves to appreciation as camp181B-televisioneditMain article B-televisionB-television is the term used by the German media scholar Heidemarie Schumacher in his article From the True the Good the Beautiful to the Truly Beautiful Goodsaudience identification strategies on German B-Television programs as an analogy to B-movie to characterize the development of German commercial television which adopted the aesthetics of commercials with its inane positiveness radiated by every participant the inclusion of clips soft focus catchy music as well as promotion of merchandise through product placement182 Schumacher notes that after 1984 deregulation German public television passed its climax and became marginalized Newly established commercial stations operating without the burden of societal legitimacy focused solely on profitability To establish and maintain viewer loyalty these stations broadcast reality shows sensational journalism daily soap operas infotainment programs talk shows game shows and soft pornographyAppeals to viewer emotions and the active participation of the consumer enhance
