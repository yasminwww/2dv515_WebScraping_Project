in other dayparts though exceptions are not rareAt a micro level scheduling is the minute planning of the transmission what to broadcast and when ensuring an adequate or maximum utilization of airtime Television scheduling strategies are employed to give shows the best possible chance of attracting and retaining an audience They are used to deliver shows to audiences when they are most likely to want to watch them and deliver audiences to advertisers in the composition that makes their advertising most likely to be effective1 With the growth of digital platforms and services allowing non-linear on-demand access to television content this approach to broadcasting has since been referred to using the retronym linear such as linear television and linear channels234Contents1 History2

hours now known as prime time Over time though television began to be seen during the day time and late at night as well on the weekends As air time increased so did the demand for new material With the exception of sports television variety shows became much more important in prime timeScheduling strategieseditBlock programmingeditMain article Block programmingBlock programming is the practice of scheduling a group of complementary programs together Blocks are typically built around specific genres ie a block focusing specifically on sitcoms target audiences or other factors Blocks also allow these programs to be promoted together under blanket brands such as ABCs TGIF lineup and NBCs Must See TVBridgingeditBridging is the practice of discouraging the audience from changing channels during the junctions between specific programs This can be done primarily by airing promos for the next program near the end of the preceding program such as during its credits5 The host of the next program may similarly make a brief appearance near the end of the preceding program sometimes interacting directly with the host to provide a preview in news broadcasting this is typically referred to as a throw or toss Owing to both programs news comedy formats the Comedy Central program The Daily Show similarly featured toss segments to promote its spin-off and lead-out The Colbert Report in which host Jon Stewart would engage in a comedic conversation with the latters host Stephen Colbert via split-screen near the end of the show6 In Argentina this practice is referred to as a pasecitation neededIn some cases a channel may intentionally allow a program to overrun into the next half-hour timeslot rather than end exactly on the half-hour in order to discourage viewers from surfing away at traditional junction periods since they had missed the beginnings of programs on other channels already This can however cause disruptions with recorders if they are not aware of the scheduling typically digital video recorders can be configured to automatically record for a set length of time before and after a schedules given timeslot in program guide data to account for possible variances78For a period TBS consistently and intentionally engaged in this practice under the name Turner Time scheduling all programs at 5 and 35 minutes past the hour rather than exactly on the half hour This also served to attract viewers tuning away from shows that had already started on another channel so that they could easily catch the next program due to the offset scheduling9CrossprogrammingeditMain article Crossover fictionCrossprogramming involves the interconnection of two shows This is achieved by extending a storyline over two episodes of two different showsCounterprogrammingeditMain article Counterprogramming televisionCounterprogramming is the practice of deliberately scheduling programming to attract viewers away from another major program Counterprogramming efforts often involve scheduling a contrasting program of a different genre or demographic targeting viewers who may not be interested in the major program such as a sporting event which typically draws a predominantly-male audience against an awards show that attracts a predominantly-female audience1011 Despite frequently being among the top US television broadcasts of all time the Super Bowl has had a prominent history of being counterprogrammed in this manner One of the most prominent examples of this practice was Foxs 1992 airing of a special live episode of In Living Color against the games halftime show1213Counterprogramming can also involve direct competitors scheduled directly against each other14 In some cases broadcasters may attempt to adjust their schedules in order to avert attempts at counterprogramming such as getting a slightly earlier time slot in the hope that once viewers have become committed to a show they will not switch channels or scheduling the competing program  on a different night to avoid competition altogether1516The professional wrestling promotion World Championship Wrestling WCW deliberately scheduled a flagship weekly show on TNT Monday Nitro to compete directly with the rival WWFs Raw on USA Network leading to an intense rivalry dubbed the Monday Night Wars At its peak Nitro which aired live for three hours often beat Raw which aired a two-hour pre-recorded program that overlapped the final two hours of Nitro in the ratings which led WWF to introduce its edgier Attitude Era to compete  To ridicule the pre-recorded competitor WCW commentators sometimes disclosed Raw spoilers on-air as a ploy to keep viewers from tuning away This tactic infamously backfired during its January 4 1999 episode when a spoiler that Mankind would win the WWF Championship had the opposite effect causing Nitro to lose around 600000 viewers to the final hour of Raw instead The Nitro main event featuring Hulk Hogan defeating Kevin Nash for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship was also marred by its unusual build-up and controversial finishdubbed the Fingerpoke of Doom Critics credited the episodes events as an example of a misstep that led towards WCWs eventual demise17181920DaypartingeditMain article DaypartingDayparting is the practice of dividing the day into several parts during each of which a different type of

between two popular shows in the hope that viewers will watch it Public television uses this as a way of promoting serious but valuable contentHotswitchingeditMain article Hot switchIn hotswitching the showmers eliminate any sort of commercial break when one show ends and another begins this immediately hooks the audience into watching the next show without a chance to change the television channel between showsSeason splittingeditMain article Split television seasonSeason splitting is the practice of broadcasting one season of a series in two parts with a scheduled break in between This allows for the second half of the season to be programmed strategically separately from the firstStackingeditStacking is a technique used to develop audience flow by grouping together shows with similar appeals to sweep the viewer along from one show to the next21StrippingeditMain article Stripping televisionStripping is running a syndicated television series every day of the week It is commonly restricted to describing the airing of shows which were weekly in their first run The West Wing could be stripped but not Jeopardy as the latter is already a daily show Shows that are syndicated in this way generally have to have run for several seasons the rule of thumb is usually 100 episodes in order to have enough episodes to run without significant repeatsTentpolingeditMain article Tent pole programmingIn tent pole programming the programmers bank on a well-known series having so much audience appeal that they can place two unknown series on either side and it is the strength of the central show that will draw viewers to the two other showsThemingeditA broadcaster may temporarily dedicate all or parts of its schedule over a period of time to a specific theme A well-known instance of a themed lineup is Discovery Channels annual Shark WeekThemed schedules are a common practice around major holidayssuch as Valentines Day Halloween and Christmaswhere channels may air specials films and episodes of their existing programs that relate to the holiday The practice can help to attract viewers interested in programming that reflects the season In conjunction with festive programs when relevant a channel may also target viewers on vacation for holiday long weekends or common school breaks by scheduling marathons of signature programs and feature film franchises the channel holds rights to or other themed programming eventsThe US basic cable networks Freeform 25 Days of Christmas 31 Days of Halloween and Hallmark Channel are known for broadcasting long-term holiday programming events After experiencing success with holiday events such as Countdown to Christmas Hallmark Channel adopted a strategy of dividing its programming into themed seasons year-round in an effort to position itself as a year-round destination for celebrations which is synergistic with Hallmark Cards core greeting card and collectibles businesses22232425Time sloteditA shows time slot or place in the schedule could be crucial to its success or failure see tentpoling aboveA time slot can affect a programs overall audience generally earlier prime time slots have a stronger appeal towards younger audiences and family viewing while later time slots such as 1000pm generally appeal more towards older demographics Some time slots colloquially known as graveyard slots or death slots are prone to having smaller potential audiences with one such example being  Friday nights26 or intense competition from high-rated series2728See alsoeditBroadcast clockEffects of
