Software engineer - WikipediaSoftware engineerFrom Wikipedia the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchPractitioner of software engineering  A software engineer writing Java codeA software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design development maintenance testing and evaluation of computer softwarePrior to the mid-1970s software practitioners generally called themselves computer scientists computer programmers or software developers regardless of their actual jobs Many people prefer to call themselves software developer and programmer because most widely agree what these terms mean while the exact meaning of software engineer is still being debatedContents1 Education11 Other degrees2 Profession21 Employment22 Impact of

technology A small but growing number of practitioners have software engineering degrees In 1987 the Department of Computing at Imperial College London introduced the first three-year software engineering Bachelors degree in the UK and the world in the following year the University of Sheffield established a similar program1  In 1996 the Rochester Institute of Technology established the first software engineering bachelors degree program in the United States however it did not obtain ABET accreditation until 2003 the same time as Rice University Clarkson University Milwaukee School of Engineering and Mississippi State University obtained theirs2 In 1997 PSG College of Technology in Coimbatore India was the first to start a five-year integrated Master of Science degree in Software Engineeringcitation neededSince then software engineering undergraduate degrees have been established at many universities A standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was recentlywhen defined by the CCSE As of 2004update in the US about 50 universities offer software engineering degrees which teach both computer science and engineering principles and practices The first software engineering Masters degree was established at Seattle University in 1979 Since then graduate software engineering degrees have been made available from many more universities  Likewise in Canada the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board CEAB of the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers has recognized several software engineering programsIn 1998 the US Naval Postgraduate School NPS established the first doctorate program in Software Engineering in the worldcitation needed Additionally many online advanced degrees in Software Engineering have appeared such as the Master of Science in Software Engineering MSE degree offered through the Computer Science and Engineering Department at California State University Fullerton Steve McConnell opines that because most universities teach computer science rather than software engineering there is a shortage of true software engineers3 ETS cole de technologie suprieure University and UQAM Universit du Qubec  Montral were mandated by IEEE to develop the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge SWEBOK which has become an ISO standard describing the body of knowledge covered by a software engineer4Other degreeseditIn business some software engineering practitioners have MIS or computer information systems degrees In embedded systems some have electrical engineering electronics engineering computer science with emphasis in embedded systems or computer engineering degrees because embedded software often requires a detailed understanding of hardware In medical software practitioners may have medical informatics general medical or biology degreescitation neededSome practitioners have mathematics science engineering or technology STEM degrees Some have philosophy logic in particular or other non-technical degreescitation needed For instance Barry Boehm earned degrees in mathematics And others have no degreescitation neededProfessioneditEmploymenteditSee also Software engineering demographicsMost software engineers work as employees or contractors Software engineers work with businesses government agencies civilian or military and non-profit organizations Some software engineers work on their own as consulting software engineers Some organizations have specialists to perform all of the tasks in the software development process Other organizations separate software engineers based on specific software-engineering tasks These companies sometimes hire interns possibly university or college students over a short time In large projects software engineers are distinguished from people who specialize in only one role because they take part in the design as well as the programming of the project In small projects software engineers will usually fill several or all roles at the same time Specializations includein industry analysts architects developers testers technical support managersin academia educators researchersImpact of globalizationeditMost students in the developed world have avoided degrees related to software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing importing software products or services from other countries and of being displaced by foreign visa workers5 Although government statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself a related career computer programming does appear to have been affected67 Often one is expected to start out as a computer programmer before being promoted to software engineer Thus the career path to software engineering may be rough especially during recessionsSome career counselors suggest a student also focus on people skills and business skills rather than purely technical skills because such soft skills are allegedly more difficult to offshoreReasonable command over reading writing  speaking English is asked by most of employers8 It is the quasi-management aspects of software engineering that appear to be what has kept it from being impacted by globalization9PrizeseditThere are several prizes in the field of software engineering10The Codie awards is a yearly award issued by the Software and Information Industry Association for excellence in software development within the software industryJolt Awards are awards in the software industryStevens Award is a software engineering award given in memory of Wayne StevensUse of the title EngineereditMain articles Software engineering professionalism and Regulation and licensure in engineeringOrigin of the termeditMargaret Hamilton promoted the term software engineering during her work on the Apollo program The term engineering was used to acknowledge that the work should be taken just as seriously as other contributions toward the advancement of technology Hamilton details her use of the termWhen I first came up with the term no one had heard of it before at least in our world It was an ongoing joke for a long time They liked to kid me about my radical ideas It was a memorable day when one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone in a meeting that he agreed with me that the process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline just like with hardware Not because of his acceptance of the new term per se but because we had earned his and the acceptance of the others in the room as being in an engineering field in its own right11Suitability of the termeditOne could argue that software engineering implies a certain level of academic training professional discipline adherence to formal processes and especially legal liability that often are not applied in cases of software development A common analogy is that working in construction does not make one a civil engineer and so writing code does not make one a software engineer Furthermore because computing doesnt utilize the methods of mathematical physics common to all conventional engineering disciplines it is more appropriate to call those engaged in this occupation as software developers or similarIn 1978 computer scientist E W Dijkstra wrote in a paper that the coining of the term software engineer was not useful since it was an inappropriate analogy The existence of the mere term has been the base of a number of extremely shallowand falseanalogies which just confuse the issue Computers are such exceptional gadgets that there is good reason to assume that most analogies with other disciplines are too shallow to be of any positive value are even so shallow that they are only confusing12In each of the last few decades at least one radical new approach has entered the mainstream of software development eg Structured Programming Object Orientation implying that the field is still changing too rapidly to be considered an engineering discipline Proponents argue that the supposedly radical new approaches are evolutionary rather than revolutionarycitation neededIndividual commentators have disagreed sharply on how to define software engineering or its legitimacy as an engineering discipline David Parnas has said that software engineering is in fact a form of engineering1314 Steve McConnell has said that it is not but that it should be15 Donald Knuth has said that programming is an art and a science16 Edsger W Dijkstra claimed that the terms software engineering and software engineer have been misusedimproper synthesis  and should be considered harmful particularly in the United States17Regulatory classificationeditCanadaeditIn Canada the use of the job title Engineer is controlled in each province by self-regulating professional engineering organizations who are also tasked with enforcement of the governing legislation The intent is that any individual holding themselves out as an engineer has been verified to have been educated to a certain accredited level and their professional practice is subject to a code of ethics and peer scrutiny It is also illegal to use the title Engineer in Canada unless an individual is licensedIn Ontario the Professional Engineers Act18 stipulates a minimum education level of a three-year diploma in technology from a College of Applied Arts and Technology or a degree in a relevant science area19 However engineering undergraduates and all other applicants are not allowed to use the title of engineer until they complete the minimum amount of work experience of four years in addition to completing the Professional Practice Examination PPE If the applicant does not hold an undergraduate engineering degree then they may have to take the Confirmatory Practice Exam or Specific Examination Program unless the exam requirements are waived by a committee2021IT professionals with degrees in other fields such as computer science or information systems are restricted from using the title Software Engineer or wording Software Engineer in a title depending on their province or territory of residencecitation neededIn some instances cases have been taken to court regarding the illegal use of the protected title Engineer22EuropeeditThroughout the whole of Europe suitably qualified engineers may obtain the professional European Engineer qualificationFranceeditIn France the term ingnieur engineer is not a protected title and can be used by anyone even by those who do not possess an academic degreeHowever the title Ingnieur Diplom Graduate Engineer is an official academic title that is protected by the government and is associated with the Diplme dIngnieur which is one of the most prestigious academic degrees in FranceIcelandeditThe use of the title tlvunarfringur computer scientist is protected by law in Iceland23 Software engineering is taught in Computer Science departments in Icelandic universities Icelandic law state that a permission must be obtained from the Minister of Industry when the degree was awarded abroad prior to use of the title The title is awarded to those who have obtained a BSc degree in Computer Science from a recognized higher educational institution24New ZealandeditIn New Zealand the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand IPENZ which licenses and regulates the countrys chartered engineers CPEng recognizes software engineering as a legitimate branch of professional engineering and accepts application of software engineers to obtain chartered status provided they have a tertiary degree of approved subjects Software Engineering is included whereas Computer Science is normally not25 As of January 2020 IPENZ had zero software engineers in their registerUnited StateseditThe Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS classifies computer software engineers as a subcategory of computer specialists along with occupations such as computer scientist Programmer Database administrator and Network administrator26 The BLS classifies all other engineering disciplines including computer hardware engineers as engineers27Many states prohibit unlicensed persons from calling themselves an Engineer or from indicating branches or specialties not covered licensing acts28293031323334353637 In many states the title Engineer is reserved for individuals with a Professional Engineering license indicating that they have shown minimum level of competency through accredited engineering education qualified engineering experience and engineering boards

engineering as an apt reflection of the fact that the design of software systems was an activity par excellence for the mathematical engineer    As soon the term arrived in the USA it was relieved of all its technical content It had to be so for in its original meaning it was totally unacceptable    In the meantime software engineering has become an almost empty term as was nicely demonstrated by
