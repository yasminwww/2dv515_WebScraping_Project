its money from selling advertisements A programme company pays the theatre for the rights to produce the productions programmes which is contrary to common belief that the theatre pays the programme company1 The programme generally contains photos of the production a cast list biographies of the actors and production staff involved the name of the theatre background information and can contain advertisements For example the programme for the original production of Man of La Mancha contained articles by the staff about how the production was created  The first theatre programmes were issued in the mid-nineteenth century in magazine format2 The original theatre programme first appeared in the 18th century The early playbills were basic with only enough pages to list the cast members and information on the plays locale and scenes There were usually only four pages the cover advertised the show a back page displayed the theatre layout and the two interior pages listed all the credits3 Not all early programmes were printed but written by hand or cut and pasted together from the letters of other printed documents The latter was especially done by theatre entrepreneur Sarah Baker who owned several theatres in Kent during the late 18th century4In early British theatre the cast was very important Audiences were very familiar with leading actors and a particular player could draw a larger crowd The programme was a kind of contract between the theatre and the audience because if an audience paid to see a particular actor and they were not presented with him there was the immediate risk of crowd hissing orange throwing or even rioting This sometimes resulted in property damage and physical assault4Programmes were not only distributed in theatres but also on the streets The distributors were often women who worked for the theatre by selling oranges as refreshments to audiences It has been alluded to that these women were also prostitutes However there was still a large rate of illiteracy among theatre goers This resulted in companies of actors traversing urban streets with a beating drum while announcing upcoming venues4By the 19th century the programmes similar to todays were being printed However the earlier playbills of the 18th century still contained more designs and information about a production5 By 1884 advertisements had become a standard feature in playbills Beginning in New York City the first company to specialize in printing theatrical programmes was founded by an Ohio business man Frank Vance Strauss By 1911 the company was called the Strauss Magazine Theatre Program3 On September 23 1920 the company then known as the New York Theatre Program Corporation advertised its sales at a million and a half per month6 This corporation was the early foundation for the modern day magazine Playbill7During World War II British theatre programmes underwent a dramatic change as the government placed restrictions over paper use The programme turned back into a single sheet of paper folded over once to efficiently create four available pages for text Not until the 1970s were photo printed programmes available and widely distributed at British theatres The American Playbill did not suffer as severely during the second World War and was still published at a regular rate2Theatre programmes have become very valuable articles of information for a city or nations cultural history An example is Australias celebration in 2008 over the returning of its earliest surviving document from Canada which was a theatre playbill from 1796 The playbill advertised the production of The Tragedy of Jane Shore George Hughes a convict aboard the First Fleet printed the playbill using Australias first printing press4In September 2017 the British Library opened its In the Spotlight project showcasing a portion of its significant collection of playbills dating from the 1730s to the 1950s Some of the librarys collection of approximately 234000 playbills bound into over 1000 volumes were digitised and made accessible online The public were asked via the project website to help bring them back into the spotlight8Sporting eventsedit  The programme from Dartford FC from the opening of their Watling Street groundThis section does not cite any sources Please help improve this section by adding citations
