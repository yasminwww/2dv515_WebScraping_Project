narrative itself might be offered to the audience in the form of programme notes inviting imaginative correlations with the music  A classic example is Hector Berliozs Symphonie fantastique which relates a series of morbid fantasies concerning the unrequited love of a sensitive poet involving murder execution and the torments of Hell The genre culminates in the symphonic works of Richard Strauss that include narrations of the adventures of Don Quixote Till Eulenspiegel the composers domestic life and an interpretation of Nietzsches philosophy of the bermensch Following Strauss the genre declined and new works with explicitly narrative content are rare Nevertheless the genre continues to exert an influence on film music especially where this draws upon the techniques of late romantic music The term is almost exclusively applied to works in the European classical music tradition particularly those from the Romantic music period of the 19th century during which the concept was popular but pieces which fit the description have long been a part of music The term is usually reserved for purely instrumental works pieces without singers and lyrics and not used for example for Opera or Lieder Single movement orchestral pieces of programme music are often called symphonic poems Absolute music in contrast is intended to be appreciated without any particular reference to

Leafe and William Byrds The Battell For the latter work the composer provided this written description of the sections Souldiers sommons marche of footemen marche of horsmen trumpetts Irishe marche bagpipe and the drone flute and the droome marche to the fighte the battels be joyned retreat galliarde for the victorieSurveying the literature on this subject will reveal several sources erroneously stating that of this is Marin Maraiss Le tableau de lOperation de la Taille which describes bladder-stone surgeryBaroque and Classical eraseditIn the Baroque era Vivaldis The Four Seasons has poetic inscriptions in the score referring to each of the seasons evoking spring summer autumn and winterWhile many cantatas by J S Bach contain programmatic elements an example of outright programme music is his Capriccio on the departure of a beloved brother BWV 992Programme music was perhaps less often composed in the Classical era At that time perhaps more than any other music achieved drama from its own internal resources notably in works written in sonata form It is thought however that a number of Joseph Haydns earlier symphonies may be programme music for example the composer once said that one of his earlier symphonies represents a dialogue between God and the Sinner It is not known which of his symphonies Haydn was referring to His Symphony No 8 also includes a movement named La Tempestura that represents a storm A minor Classical-era composer Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf wrote a series of symphonies based on Ovids Metamorphoses not to be confused with twentieth-century composer Benjamin Brittens Six Metamorphoses after OvidRomantic periodeditProgramme music particularly flourished in the Romantic era As it can invoke in the listener a specific experience other than sitting in front of a musician or musicians it is related to the purely Romantic idea of the Gesamtkunstwerk describing Wagners Operas as a fusion of many arts set design choreography poetry and so on although it relies solely on musical aspects to illustrate a multi-faceted artistic concept such as a poem or a painting Composers believed that the dynamics of sound that were newly possible in the Romantic orchestra of the era allowed them to focus on emotions and other intangible aspects of life much more than during the Baroque or Classical erasLudwig van Beethoven felt a certain reluctance in writing programme music and said of his 1808 Symphony No 6 Pastoral that the whole work can be perceived without description  it is more an expression of feelings rather than tone-painting1 Yet the work clearly contains depictions of bird calls a babbling brook a storm and so on Beethoven later returned to programme music with his Piano Sonata Op 81a Les Adieux which depicts the departure and return of his close friend the Archduke RudolphHector Berliozs Symphonie fantastique was a musical narration of a hyperbolically emotional love story the main subject being an actress with whom he was in love at the time Franz Liszt did provide explicit programs for many of his piano pieces but he is also the inventor of the term symphonic poem In 1874 Modest Mussorgsky composed for piano a series of pieces describing seeing a gallery of ten of his friends paintings and drawings in his Pictures at an Exhibition later orchestrated by many composers including Maurice Ravel The French composer Camille Saint-Sans wrote many short pieces of programme music which he called Tone Poems His most famous are probably the Danse Macabre and several movements from the Carnival of the Animals The composer Paul Dukas is perhaps best known for his tone poem The Sorcerers Apprentice based on a tale from GoethePossibly the most adept at musical depiction in his programme music was German composer Richard Strauss His symphonic poems include Death and Transfiguration portraying a dying man and his entry into heaven Don Juan based on the ancient legend of Don Juan Till Eulenspiegels Merry Pranks based on episodes in the career of the legendary German figure Till Eulenspiegel Don Quixote portraying episodes in the life of Miguel de Cervantes character Don Quixote A Heros Life which depicts episodes in the life of an unnamed hero often taken to be Strauss himself and Symphonia Domestica which portrays episodes in the composers own married life including putting the baby to bed Strauss is reported to have said that music can describe anything even a teaspoon2Another composer of programmatic music is Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov whose colorful musical pictures include Sadko Op 5 after the Russian Bylina about the minstrel who sings to the Tsar of the Sea the very famous Scheherazade Op 35 after the Arabian Nights entertainments where the heroine is depicted by a violin and whose stories include Sinbad the Sailor and any number of orchestral suites from his operas including The Tale of Tsar Saltan which also contains Flight of the Bumblebee The Golden Cockerel Christmas Eve The Snow Maiden and The Legend of The Invisible City of KitezhIn Scandinavia Sibelius explored the Kalevala legend in several tone poems most famously in The Swan of TuonelaOne of the most famous programs because it has never been definitively identified is the secret non-musical idea or theme  the Enigma  that underlies Edward Elgars Variations on an Original Theme Enigma of 1899 The composer disclosed it to certain friends but at his request they never made it publicTwentieth centuryeditOttorino Respighi composed a number of tone poems in the 1910s and 1920s notably three works on different aspects of the city of Rome Gustav Holsts The Planets is another well-known example Alban Bergs Lyric Suite was thought for years to be abstract music but in 1977 it was discovered that it was in fact dedicated to Hanna Fuchs-Robettin3 Important leitmotifs are based on the melodic series ABHF which is their combined initials The last movement also contains a setting of a poem by Charles Baudelaire suppressed by the composer for publication 1Popular music as programme musiceditThe term programme music is not generally used with regard to popular music although some popular music does have aspects in common with programme music The tradition of purely orchestral programme music is continued in pieces for jazz orchestra most notably several pieces by Duke Ellington Instrumental pieces in popular music often have a descriptive title which suggests that they could be categorized as programme music and several instrumental albums are completely devoted to some programmatic idea for example China by Vangelis or The Songs of Distant Earth by Mike Oldfield Some of the genres of popular music are more likely than others to involve programmatic elements these include ambient new-age space music surf rock black metal jazz fusion progressive rock art rock and various genres of techno music Bluegrass has at least one outstanding bit of programme music called Orange Blossom Special Progressive rock groups and musicians during the 1970s in particular experimented with programme music among which was Rushs Jacobs Ladder 1980 which shows clear influences of Smetanas M vlast My Homeland 18741879 In addition Rushs songs Xanadu Red Barchetta and YYZ also show their experimentalism with programme music as do parts of 2112 particularly the discovery sceneDefinitioneditComposers and some theorists argue that there is indeed no such thing as true absolute ars gratia artis music and that music always at least conveys or evokes emotions While non-professional listeners often claim that music has meaning to them new musicologists such as Susan McClary 1999 argue that so-called abstract techniques and structures are actually highly politically and socially charged specifically even gendered This may be linked to a more general argument against abstraction such as Mark Johnsons argument that it is necessaryfor abstract meaningto have a bodily basis McClary 1991 However a more specific definition of absolute music is music which was composed without programmatic intent or narrativeMore traditional listeners often reject these views sharply asserting that music can be meaningful as well as deeply emotional while being essentially about itself notes themes keys and so on and without any connection to the political and societal conflicts of our own day but consciously associated with non-musical ideas images or events poems art works etcIn the Western canoneditThis section does not cite any sources Please help

to remove this template messageBaroque and Classical eraseditPart of the music from the Baroque and Classical eras is absolute as is suggested by titles which often consist simply of the type of composition a numerical designation within the composers oeuvre and its key Bachs Concerto for Two Harpsichords in C Minor BWV 1060 Mozarts Piano Sonata in C Major K 545 and Beethovens Symphony No 7 in A major Opus 92 are all examples of absolute musicContrarywise some composers of the Baroque era used to design titles for their music in a fashion resemblant to that of Romantic programme music called the rappresentativo representative style Some of the most notable examples were composed by Antonio Vivaldi  some of his violin flute or recorder concertos bear titles inspired by human affects Il piacere  the pleasure occupations La caccia  the hunting La pastorella  the shepherdess or most notably aspects of nature and meteors The Four Seasons La notte  the night La tempesta di mare  the sea storm Another well-known example is Heinrich Ignaz Bibers Sonata representativa for violin and continuo which depicts various animals the nightingale the cuckoo the cat in a humoristic mannerRomantic eraeditProgram music was quite popular during the Romantic era Many mainstream classical works are unequivocally programme music such as Richard Strausss An Alpine Symphony which is a musical description of ascending and descending a mountain with 22 section titles such as Night Sunrise By the Waterfall In Thicket and Underbrush on the Wrong Path Summit Mists Rise and Storm and Descent Beethovens Symphony No 6 is clearly programme music too with titled movements and instrumental depictions of bird calls country dances and a storm His fifteenth string quartet Opus 132 contains a middle movement titled Heiliger Dankgesang eines Genesenen an die Gottheit in der lydischen Tonart A Convalescents Holy Song of Thanksgiving to the Divinity in the Lydian Mode suggesting to some auditors that the entire work can be heard as a tonal evocation of sickness and recovery Some might criticize Disneys animators for providing a pictorial interpretation of Bachs Toccata and Fugue in D Minor but nobody can deny an extramusical association for Dukass The Sorcerers ApprenticeModern eraeditDuring the twentieth century the increased influence of modernism and other anti-Romantic trends contributed to a decline in esteem for programme music but audiences continued to enjoy such pieces as Arthur Honeggers depiction of a steam locomotive in Pacific 231 Indeed Percy Graingers incomplete orchestral fragment Train Music employs the same function This music for large orchestra depicts a train moving in the mountains of ItalyOpera and balleteditMusic that is composed to accompany a ballet is often programme music even when presented separately as a concert piece Aaron Copland was amused when a listener said that when she listened to Appalachian Spring she could see the Appalachians and feel Spring the title having been a last-minute thought but it is certainly programme music Film scores and the orchestration in operas are very often programme music and some film scores such as Prokofievs music for Alexander Nevsky have even found a place in the classical concert repertoireProgrammatic music and abstract imageryeditA good deal of programme music falls in between the realm of purely programmatic and purely absolute with titles that clearly suggest an extramusical association but no detailed story that can be followed and no musical passages that can be unequivocally identified with specific images Examples would include Dvoks Symphony No 9 From the New World or Beethovens Symphony No 3 EroicaPopular musiceditBecause the overwhelming majority of Western popular music is in song form it would seem that most popular music is programmatic by nature  it has lyrics therefore it is about something other than the music itselfA common term for non-vocal popular music and thus for practical purposes a term for absolute music in a popular context is instrumental or instrumental sectionWhile the debate is of interest to many for practical purposes most scholars use the term programme music in the narrower sense described aboveMotion picture soundtrackeditInfluenced by the late Romantic work of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov Ottorino Respighi Richard Strauss and others motion picture soundtrack took up the banner of programmatic music following the advent of talkies Many film composers including Paul Smith Ennio Morricone and John Williams whose 1977 Star Wars soundtrack redefined the symphonic movie score have followed the programmatic model and solidified motion picture soundtrack as its own programmatic genre Musics power for pictorial suggestion may be said to have culminated in Walt Disneys 1940 film Fantasia Disney gave us too the term Mickey Mousing used to describe scores that mimic too obviously the movements of nature The music of Max Steiner for instance often lauded for its uncanny sound-image synchronization has also been assailed for being too Mickey MouseExampleseditPictures at an Exhibition by Modest
