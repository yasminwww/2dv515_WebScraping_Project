semi-fiction intended to be more serious than humorous in tone1 Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre such as police crime drama political drama legal drama historical period drama domestic drama teen drama or comedy-drama These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moodsAll forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent mimesis characters In this broader sense drama is a mode distinct from novels short stories and narrative poetry or songs2 In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries along with film studies adopted Radio drama has been used in both sensesoriginally transmitted in a live performance it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of
