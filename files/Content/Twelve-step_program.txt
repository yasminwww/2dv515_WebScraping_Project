Twelve-step program - WikipediaTwelve-step programFrom Wikipedia the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchA twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction compulsion or other behavioral problems Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous AA as a method of recovery from alcoholism1 the Twelve Steps were first published in the 1939 book Alcoholics Anonymous The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism2 The method was adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programsAs summarized by the American Psychological Association the process involves the following1admitting that one cannot control ones alcoholism addiction or compulsionrecognizing a higher power that can give strengthexamining past errors with the help of a sponsor experienced membermaking amends for these errorslearning to live a new life with a new code of behaviorhelping others who suffer from the same

organizationsoften known as fellowshipswith a worldwide membership of millionsnow employ twelve-step principles for recovery Narcotics Anonymous was formed by addicts who did not relate to the specifics of alcohol dependency3Demographic preferences related to the addicts drug of choice has led to the creation of Cocaine Anonymous Crystal Meth Anonymous and Marijuana Anonymous Behavioral issues such as compulsion for andor addiction to gambling crime food sex hoarding getting into debt and work are addressed in fellowships such as Gamblers Anonymous Overeaters Anonymous Sexaholics Anonymous and Debtors AnonymousAuxiliary groups such as Al-Anon and Nar-Anon for friends and family members of alcoholics and addicts respectively are part of a response to treating addiction as a disease that is enabled by family systems4 Adult Children of Alcoholics ACA or ACOA addresses the effects of growing up in an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family Co-Dependents Anonymous CoDA addresses compulsions related to relationships referred to as codependencyHistoryeditFurther information History of Alcoholics AnonymousAlcoholics Anonymous AA the first twelve-step fellowship was founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr Robert Holbrook Smith known to AA members as Bill W and Dr Bob in Akron Ohio In 1946 they formally established the twelve traditions to help deal with the issues of how various groups could relate and function as membership grew56 The practice of remaining anonymous using only ones first names when interacting with the general public was published in the first edition of the AA Big Book7As AA chapters were increasing in number during the 1930s and 1940s the guiding principles were gradually defined as the Twelve Traditions A singleness of purpose emerged as Tradition Five Each group has but one primary purposeto carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers8 Consequently drug addicts who do not suffer from the specifics of alcoholism involved in AA hoping for recovery technically are not welcome in closed meetings unless they have a desire to stop drinking alcohol9The principles of AA have been used to form many numbers of other fellowships specifically designed for those recovering from various pathologies each emphasizes recovery from the specific malady which brought the sufferer into the fellowship10Twelve StepseditFurther information List of Twelve Step alternate wordingsThe following are the original twelve steps as published by Alcoholics Anonymous11We admitted we were powerless over alcoholthat our lives had become unmanageableCame to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanityMade a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood HimMade a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselvesAdmitted to God to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongsWere entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of characterHumbly asked Him to remove our shortcomingsMade a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them allMade direct amends to such people wherever possible except when to do so would injure them or othersContinued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted itSought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that outHaving had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairsIn some cases where other twelve-step groups have adapted the AA steps as guiding principles step one is uniquely different for each organization for example in Overeaters Anonymous the first step read We admitted we were powerless over compulsive overeating- that our lives had become unmanageable  The first step is also sometimes altered to emphasize principles important to those particular fellowships or to remove gender-specific pronouns language12131415Twelve TraditionseditMain article Twelve TraditionsThe Twelve Traditions accompany the Twelve Steps The Traditions provide guidelines for group governance They were developed in AA in order to help resolve conflicts in the areas of publicity politics religion and finances16 Alcoholics Anonymous Twelve Traditions are7Our common welfare should come first personal recovery depends upon AA unityFor our group purpose there is but one ultimate authoritya loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience Our leaders are but trusted servants they do not governThe only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinkingEach group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or AA as a wholeEach group has but one primary purposeto carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffersAn AA group ought never endorse finance or lend the AA name to any related facility or outside enterprise lest problems of money property and prestige divert us from our primary purposeEvery AA group ought to be fully self-supporting declining outside contributionsAlcoholics Anonymous should remain forever non-professional but our service centers may employ special workersAA as such ought never be organized but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serveAlcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues hence the AA name ought never be drawn into public controversyOur public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion we need always to maintain personal anonymity at the level of press radio and filmsAnonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions ever reminding us to place principles before personalitiesProcesseditIn the twelve-step program the human structure is symbolically represented in three dimensions physical mental and spiritual The problems the groups deal with are understood to manifest themselves in each dimension For addicts and alcoholics the physical dimension is best described by the allergy-like bodily reaction resulting in the compulsion to continue using substances after the initial use1718 The statement in the First Step that the individual is powerless over the substance-abuse related behavior at issue refers to the lack of control over this compulsion which persists despite any negative consequences that may be endured as a result19The mental obsession is described as the cognitive processes that cause the individual to repeat the compulsive behavior after some period of abstinence either knowing that the result will be an inability to stop or operating under the delusion that the result will be different The description in the First Step of the life of the alcoholic or addict as unmanageable refers to the lack of choice that the mind of the addict or alcoholic affords concerning whether to drink or use again20The illness of the spiritual dimension or spiritual malady is considered in all twelve-step groups to be self-centeredness1718 The process of working the steps is intended to replace self-centeredness with a growing moral consciousness and a willingness for self-sacrifice and unselfish constructive action18 In twelve-step groups this is known as a spiritual awakening21 This should neither be confused with abreaction which produces dramatic but ephemeral changes22 nor with a religious experience In twelve-step fellowships spiritual awakening is believed to most frequently develop slowly over a period of time23In accordance with the First Step twelve-step groups emphasize self-admission by members of the problem they are recovering from It is in this spirit that members often identify themselves along with an admission of their problem often as Hi Im first name only and Im an alcoholic24SponsorshipeditA sponsor is a more experienced person in recovery who guides the less-experienced aspirant sponsee through the programs twelve steps New members in twelve-step programs are encouraged to secure a relationship with at least one sponsor who both has a sponsor and has taken the twelve steps themselves25 Publications from twelve-step fellowships emphasize that sponsorship is a one on one nonhierarchical relationship of shared experiences focused on working the Twelve Steps262728 According to Narcotics AnonymousSponsors share their experience strength and hope with their sponsees A sponsors role is not that of a legal adviser a banker a parent a marriage counselor or a social worker Nor is a sponsor a therapist offering some sort of professional advice A sponsor is simply another addict in recovery who is willing to share his or her journey through the Twelve Steps29Sponsors and sponsees participate in activities that lead to spiritual growth Experiences in the program are often shared by outgoing members with incoming members This rotation of experience is often considered to have a great spiritual reward30 These may include practices such as literature discussion and study meditation and writing Completing the program usually implies competency to guide newcomers which is often encouraged31 Sponsees typically do their Fifth Step review their moral inventory written as part of the Fourth Step with their sponsor The Fifth Step as well as the Ninth Step have been compared to confession and penitence32 Michel Foucault a French philosopher noted such practices produce intrinsic modifications in the personexonerating redeeming and purifying them relieves them of their burden of wrong liberating them and promising salvation3233The personal nature of the behavioral issues that lead to seeking help in twelve-step fellowships results in a strong relationship between sponsee and sponsor As the relationship is based on spiritual principles it is unique and not generally characterized as friendship Fundamentally the sponsor has the single purpose of helping the sponsee recover from the behavioral problem that brought the sufferer into twelve-step work which reflexively helps the sponsor recover25A study of sponsorship as practiced in Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous found that providing direction and support to other alcoholics and addicts is associated with sustained abstinence for the sponsor but suggested that there were few short-term benefits for the sponsees one-year sustained abstinence rate3435EffectivenesseditSee also Effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous

addiction For example the third-largest twelve-step program Al-Anon assists family members and friends of people who have alcoholism and other addictions About twenty percent of twelve-step programs are for substance addiction recovery the other eighty percent address a variety of problems from debt to depression36 It would be an error to assume the effectiveness of twelve-step methods at

Gamblers Anonymous Criticism Narcotics Anonymous Controversies Gamblers Anonymous Criticism Narcotics Anonymous Controversies and Overeaters Anonymous CriticismThe criticisms of twelve-step groups are as varied as the pathologies they address People have attended twelve-step meetings only to find success eluded them Their varied success rate and the belief in a Higher Power suggested in them are common criticisms of their universal applicability and efficacy38ConfidentialityeditThe Twelve Traditions encourage members to practice the spiritual principle of anonymity in the public media and members are also asked to respect each others confidentiality39 This is a group norm39 however and not legally mandated there are no legal consequences to discourage those attending twelve-step groups from revealing information disclosed during meetings40 Statutes on group therapy do not encompass those associations that lack a professional therapist or clergyman to whom confidentiality and privilege might apply Professionals and paraprofessionals who refer patients to these groups to avoid both civil liability and licensure problems have been advised that they should alert their patients that at any time their statements made in meetings may be disclosed40Cultural identityeditOne review warned of detrimental iatrogenic effects of twelve-step philosophy and labeled the organizations as cults41 while another review asserts that these programs bore little semblance to religious cults and that the techniques used appeared beneficial to some42 Another study found that a twelve-step programs focus on self-admission of having a problem increases deviant stigma and strips members of their previous cultural identity replacing it with the deviant identity43 Another study asserts that the prior cultural identity may not be replaced entirely but rather members found adapted a bicultural identity44See alsoeditAddiction recovery groupsDrug rehabilitationEffectiveness of
