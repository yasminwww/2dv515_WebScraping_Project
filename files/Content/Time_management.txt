Time management - WikipediaTime managementFrom Wikipedia the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchthe process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activitiesTime management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities especially to increase effectiveness efficiency and productivity It involves a juggling act of various demands upon a person relating to work social life family hobbies personal interests and commitments with the finiteness of time Using time effectively gives the person choice on spendingmanaging activities at their own time and expediency1 Time management may be aided by a range of skills tools and techniques used to manage time when accomplishing specific tasks projects and goals complying with a due date Initially time management referred to just business or work activities but eventually the term broadened to include personal activities as well A time management system is a designed combination of processes tools techniques and methods Time management is usually a necessity in any project development as it determines the project completion time and scope It is also important to understand that both technical and structural differences in time management exist due to variations in cultural concepts of timeThe major themes arising from the literature on time management include the followingCreating an environment conducive to effectivenessSetting of prioritiesThe related process of reduction of time spent on non-prioritiesImplementation of goalsContents1 Related concepts2 Cultural views of time management3 Creating an effective environment4 Setting priorities and goals41 ABCD analysis42 Pareto analysis43 The Eisenhower Method44 POSEC

Further readingRelated conceptseditTime management is related to different concepts such asProject management Time management can be considered to be a project management subset and is more commonly known as project planning and project scheduling Time management has also been identified as one of the core functions identified in project management2Attention management relates to the management of cognitive resources and in particular the time that humans allocate their mind and organize the minds of their employees to conduct some activitiesOrganizational time management is the science of identifying valuing and reducing time cost wastage within organizations It identifies reports and financially values sustainable time wasted time and effective time within an organization and develops the business case to convert wasted time into productive time through the funding of products services projects or initiatives at a positive return on investmentCultural views of time managementeditDifferences in the way a culture views time can affect the way their time is managed For example a linear time view is a way of conceiving time as flowing from one moment to the next in a linear fashion This linear perception of time is predominant in America along with most Northern European countries such as Germany Switzerland and England3 People in these cultures tend to place a large value on productive time management and tend to avoid decisions or actions that would result in wasted time3 This linear view of time correlates to these cultures being more monochronic or preferring to do only one thing at a time Generally speaking this cultural view leads to a better focus on accomplishing a singular task and hence more productive time managementAnother cultural time view is multi-active time view In multi-active cultures most people feel that the more activities or tasks being done at once the happier they are3 Multi-active cultures are polychronic or prefer to do multiple tasks at once This multi-active time view is prominent in most Southern European countries such as Spain Portugal and Italy3 In these cultures the people often tend to spend time on things they deem to be more important such as placing a high importance on finishing social conversations3 In business environments they often pay little attention to how long meetings last rather the focus is on having high quality meetings In general the cultural focus tends to be on synergy and creativity over efficiency4A final cultural time view is a cyclical time view In cyclical cultures time is considered neither linear nor event related Because days months years seasons and events happen in regular repetitive occurrences time is viewed as cyclical In this view time is not seen as wasted because it will always come back later hence there is an unlimited amount of it3 This cyclical time view is prevalent throughout most countries in Asia including Japan China and Tibet It is more important in cultures with cyclical concepts of time to complete tasks correctly therefore most people will spend more time thinking about decisions and the impact they will have before acting on their plans4 Most people in cyclical cultures tend to understand that other cultures have different perspectives of time and are cognizant of this when acting on a global stageCreating an effective environmenteditSomewhich time-management literature stresses tasks related to the creation of an environment conducive to real effectiveness These strategies include principles such asget organized - the triage of paperwork and of tasksprotecting ones time by insulation isolation and delegationachievement through goal-management and through goal-focus - motivational emphasisrecovering from bad time-habits - recovery from underlying psychological problems eg procrastinationIn addition the timing of tackling tasks is important as tasks requiring high levels of concentration and mental energy are often done in the beginning of the day when a person is more refreshed  Literaturewhich also focuses on overcoming chronic psychological issues such as procrastinationExcessive and chronic inability to manage time effectively may result from Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD or attention deficit disorder ADD5 Diagnostic criteria include a sense of underachievement difficulty getting organized trouble getting started trouble managing many simultaneous projects and trouble with follow-through6pageneeded Some authorswhich focus on the prefrontal cortex which is the most recently evolved part of the brain It controls the functions of attention span impulse control organization learning from experience and self-monitoring among others Some authorsquantify argue that changing the way the prefrontal cortex works is possible and offer a solution7Setting priorities and goalseditTime management strategies are often associated with the recommendation to set personal goals The literature stresses themes such asWork in Priority Order  set goals and prioritizeSet gravitational goals  that attract actions automaticallycitation neededThese goals are recorded and may be broken down into a project an action plan or a simple task list For individual tasks or for goals an importance rating may be established deadlines may be set and priorities assigned This process results in a plan with a task list or a schedule or calendar of activities Authors may recommend a daily weekly monthly or other planning periods associated with different scope of planning or review This is done in various ways as followsABCD analysiseditA technique that has been used in business management for a long time is the categorization of large data into groups These groups are often marked A B and Chence the name Activities are ranked by these general criteriaA  Tasks that are perceived as being urgent and importantB  Tasks that are important but not urgentC  Tasks that are unimportant but urgentD  Tasks that are unimportant and not urgentEach group is then rank-ordered by priority To further refine the prioritization some individuals choose to then force-rank all B items as either A or C ABC analysis can incorporate more than three groups8ABC analysis is frequently combined with Pareto analysiscitation neededPareto analysiseditSee also Pareto analysisThis is the idea that 80 of tasks can be completed in 20 of the disposable time and the remaining 20 of tasks will take up 80 of the time This principle is used to sort tasks into two parts According to this form of Pareto analysis it is recommended that tasks that fall into the first category be assigned a higher priorityclarification neededThe 80-20-rule can also be applied to increase productivity it is assumed that 80 of the productivity can be achieved by doing 20 of the tasks Similarly 80 of results can be attributed to 20 of activity9 If productivity is the aim of time management then these tasks should be prioritized higher10The Eisenhower Methodedit  A basic Eisenhower box to help evaluate urgency and importance Items may be placed at more precise points within each quadrantThe Eisenhower Method stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D Eisenhower I have two kinds of problems the urgent and the important The urgent are not important and the important are never urgent11Note that Eisenhower does not claim this insight for his own but attributes it to an unnamed former college president12Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle tasks are evaluated using the criteria importantunimportant and urgentnot urgent1314 and then placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix also known as an Eisenhower Box or Eisenhower Decision Matrix15 Tasks are then handled as followsTasks inImportantUrgent quadrant are done immediately and personally16 eg crises deadlines problems15ImportantNot Urgent quadrant get an end date and are done personally16 eg relationships planning recreation15UnimportantUrgent quadrant are delegated16 eg interruptions meetings activities15UnimportantNot Urgent quadrant are dropped16 eg time wasters pleasant activities trivia15This method is inspired by the above quote from US President Dwight D Eisenhower Note however that Eisenhower seems to say that things are never both important and urgent or neither So he has two kinds of problems the urgent and the importantPOSEC methodeditPOSEC is an acronym for Prioritize by Organizing Streamlining Economizing and Contributing The method dictates a template which emphasizes an average individuals immediate sense of emotional and monetary security It suggests that by attending to ones personal responsibilities first an individual is better positioned to shoulder collective responsibilities17Inherent in the acronym is a hierarchy of self-realization which mirrors Abraham Maslows hierarchy of needsPrioritize  Your time and define your life by goalsOrganize  Things you have to accomplish regularly to be successful family and financesStreamline  Things you may not like to do but must do work and choresEconomize  Things you should do or may even like to do but theyre not pressingly urgent pastimes and socializingContribute  By paying attention to the few remaining things that make a difference social obligationsElimination of non-prioritieseditTime management also covers how to eliminate tasks that do not provide value to the individual or organizationAccording to Sandberg18 task lists arent the key to productivity that theyre cracked up to be He reports an estimated 30 of listers spend more time managing their lists than they do completing whats on themHendrickson asserts19 that rigid adherence to task lists can create a tyranny of the to-do list that forces one to waste time on unimportant activitiesAny form of stress is considered to be debilitative for learning and life even if adaptability could be acquired its effects are damaging20 But stress is an unavoidable part of daily life and Reinhold Niebuhr suggests to face it as if having the serenity to accept the things one cannot change and having the courage to change the things one canPart of setting priorities and goals is the emotion worry and its function is to ignore the present to fixate on a future that never arrives which leads to the fruitless expense of ones time and energy It is an unnecessary cost or a false aspect that can interfere with plans due to human factors The Eisenhower Method is a strategy used to compete worry and dull-imperative tasks21 Worry as stress is a reaction to a set of environmental factors understanding this is not a part of the person gives the person possibilities to manage them Athletes under a coach call this management as putting the game face22Change is hard and daily life patterns are the most deeply ingrained habits of all To eliminate non-priorities in study time it is suggested to divide the tasks capture the moments review task handling method postpone unimportant tasks understood by its current relevancy and sense of urgency reflects wants of the person rather than importance control life balance rest sleep leisure and cheat leisure and non productive time hearing audio taping of lectures going through presentations of lectures when in queue etc23Certain unnecessary factors that affect time management are habits lack of task definition lack of clarity over-protectiveness of the work guilt of not meeting objectives and subsequent avoidance of present tasks defining tasks with higher expectations than their worth over-qualifying focusing on matters that have an apparent positive outlook without assessing their importance to personal needs tasks that require support and time sectional interests and conflicts etc24 A habituated systematic process becomes a device that the person can use with ownership for effective time managementImplementation of goalseditTo do redirects here For the auxiliary use of the verb to do in the English language see Do-supportSee also shopping list  A to-do form with checkboxes tattooed into a persons arm Some items have been written out with a black penA task list also called a to-do list or things-to-do is a list of tasks to be completed such as chores or steps toward completing a project It is an inventory tool which serves as an alternative or supplement to memoryTask lists are used in self-management business management project management and software development It may involve more than one listWhen one of the items on a task list is accomplished the task is checked or crossed off The traditional method is to write these on a piece of paper with a pen or pencil usually on a note pad or clip-board Task lists can also have the form of paper or software checklistsWriter Julie Morgenstern suggests dos and donts of time management that includeMap out everything that is important by making a task listCreate an oasis of time for one to controlSay NoSet prioritiesDont drop everythingDont think a critical task will get done in ones spare time25Numerous digital equivalents are now available including personal information management PIM applications and most PDAs There are also several web-based task list applications many of which are freeTask list organizationeditTask lists are often diarised and tiered The simplest tiered system includes a general to-do list or task-holding file to record all the tasks the person needs to accomplish and a daily to-do list which is created each day by transferring tasks from the general to-do list An alternative is to create a not-to-do list to avoid unnecessary tasks25Task lists are often prioritizedA daily list of things to do numbered in the order of their importance and done in that order one at a time until daily time allows is attributed to consultant Ivy Lee 18771934 as the most profitable advice received by Charles M Schwab 18621939 president of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation262728An early advocate of ABC prioritization was Alan Lakein in 1973 In his system A items were the most important A-1 the most important within that group B next most important C least important8A particular method of applying the ABC method29 assigns A to tasks to be done within a day B a week and C a monthTo prioritize a daily task list one either records the tasks in the order of highest priority or assigns them a number after they are listed 1 for highest priority 2 for second highest priority etc which indicates in which order to execute the tasks The latter method is generally faster allowing the tasks to be recorded more quickly25Another way of prioritizing compulsory tasks group A is to put the most unpleasant one first When its done the rest of the list feels easier Groups B and C can benefit from the same idea but instead of doing the first task which is the most unpleasant right away it gives motivation to do other tasks from the list to avoid the first oneA completely different approach which argues against prioritising altogether was put forward by British author Mark Forster in his book Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management This is based on the idea of operating closed to-do lists instead of the traditional open to-do list He argues that the traditional never-ending to-do lists virtually guarantees that some of your work will be left undone This approach advocates getting all your work done every day and if you are unable to achieve it helps you diagnose where you are going wrong and what needs to change30Various writers have stressed potential difficulties with to-do lists such as the followingManagement of the list can take over from implementing it This could be caused by procrastination by prolonging the planning activity This is akin to analysis paralysis As with any activity theres a point of diminishing returnsTo remain flexible a task system must allow for disaster A company must be ready for a disaster Even if it is a small disaster if no one made time for this situation it can metastasize potentially causing damage to the company31To avoid getting stuck in a wasteful pattern the task system should also include regular monthly semi-annual and annual planning and system-evaluation sessions to weed out inefficiencies and ensure the user is headed in the direction he or she truly desires32If some time is not regularly spent on achieving long-range goals the individual may get stuck in a perpetual holding pattern on short-term plans like staying at a particular job much longer than originally planned33Software applicationseditMany companies use time tracking software to track an employees working time billable hours etc eg law practice management softwareMany software products for time management support multiple users They allow the person to give tasks to other users and use the software for communicationTask list applications may be thought of as lightweight personal information manager or project management softwareModern task list applications may have built-in task hierarchy tasks are composed of subtasks which again may contain subtasks34 may support multiple methods of filtering and ordering the list of tasks and may allow one to associate arbitrarily long notes for each taskIn contrast to the concept of allowing the person to use multiple filtering methods at least one software product additionally contains a mode where the software will attempt to dynamically determine the best tasks for any given moment35Time management systemseditTime management systems often include a time clock or web-based application used to track an employees work hours Time management systems give employers insights into their workforce allowing them to see plan and manage employees time Doing so allows employers to control labor costs and increase productivity A time management system automates processes which eliminates paper work and tedious tasksGTD Getting Things DoneeditGetting Things Done was created by David Allen The basic idea behind this method is to finish all the small tasks immediately and a big task is to be divided into smaller tasks to start completing now The reasoning behind this is to avoid the information overload or brain freeze which is likely to occur when there are hundreds of tasks The thrust of GTD is to encourage the user to get their tasks and ideas out and on paper and organized as quickly as possible so theyre easy to manage and seePomodoroeditFrancesco Cirillos Pomodoro Technique was originally conceived in the late 1980s and gradually refined until it was later defined in 1992 The technique is the namesake of a pomodoro Italian for tomato shaped kitchen timer initially used by Cirillo during his time at university The Pomodoro is described as the fundamental metric of time within the technique and is traditionally defined as being 30 minutes long consisting of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time Cirillo also recommends a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes after every four Pomodoros Through experimentation involving various work groups and mentoring activities Cirillo determined the ideal Pomodoro to be 2035 minutes long36See alsoeditAction itemAfrican timeAttention managementCalendaring softwareChronemicsFlow psychologyGantt chartGoal settingInterruption scienceMaestro
