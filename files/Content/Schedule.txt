business are going to work at which times to ensure the effective distribution of labor resourcesA schedule or a timetable as a basic time-management tool consists of a list of times at which possible tasks events or actions are intended to take place or of a sequence of events in the chronological order in which such things are intended to take place The process of creating a schedule  deciding how to order these tasks and how to commit resources between the variety of possible tasks  is called scheduling12 and a person responsible for making a particular schedule may be called a scheduler Making and following schedules is an ancient human activity3Some scenarios associate this kind of planning with learning life skills45Schedules are necessary or at least useful in situations where individuals need to know what time they must be at a specific location to receive a specific service and where people need to accomplish a set of goals within a set time periodSchedules can usefully span both short periods such as a daily or weekly schedule and long-term planning with respect to periods of several months or years6 They are often made using a calendar where the person making the schedule can note the dates and times at which various events are planned to occur Schedules that do not set forth specific times for events to occur may instead list algorithmically an expected order in which events either can or must take placeIn some situations schedules can be uncertain such as where the conduct of daily life relies on environmental factors outside human control7 People who are vacationing or otherwise seeking to reduce stress and achieve relaxation may intentionally avoid having a schedule for a certain period of time8Contents1 Kinds of schedules11 Publicly available

ReferencesKinds of scheduleseditPublicly available scheduleseditCertain kinds of schedules reflect information that is generally made available to the public so that members of the public can plan certain activities around them These may include things likeHours of operation of businesses tourist attractions and government offices which allow consumers of these services to know when they can obtain themTransportation schedules such as airline timetables train schedules bus schedules and various public transport timetables are published to allow commuters to plan their travels From the perspective of the organization responsible for making transportation available schedules must provide for the possibility of schedule delay a term in transport modeling which refers to a difference between a desired time of arrival or departure and the actual time Despite the use of delay it can refer to a difference in either the early or late directionIn broadcast programming the minute planning of the content of a radio or television broadcast channel the result of that activity is the generation of a list of shows to be broadcast at regular times or at specific times which is then distributed to the public so that the potential audience for the show will know when it will be available to themConcerts and sporting events are typically scheduled so that fans can plan to buy tickets and attend the eventsInternal scheduleseditAn internal schedule is a schedule that is only of importance to the people who must directly abide by it It has been noted that groups often begin with a schedule imposed from the outside but effective groups also develop an internal schedule that sets goals for the completion of micro-tasks9 Unlike schedules for public events or publicly available amenities there is no need to go to the time and effort of publicizing the internal schedule To the contrary an internal schedule may be kept confidential as a matter of security or proprietyAn example of an internal schedule is a workplace schedule which lists the hours that specific employees are expected to be in a workplace ensure sufficient staffing at all times while in some instances avoiding overstaffing A work schedule for a business that is open to the public must correspond to the hours of operation of the business so that employees are available at times when customers are able to use the services of the business One common method of scheduling employees to ensure the availability of appropriate resources is a Gantt chart Another example of an internal schedule is the class schedule of an individual student indicating what days and times their classes will be heldcitation neededProject management schedulingeditMain article Schedule project managementA schedule may also involve the completion of a project with which the public has no interaction public prior to its completion In project management a formal schedule will often be created as an initial step in carrying out a specific project such as the construction of a building development of a product or launch of a program Establishing a project management schedule involves listing milestones activities and deliverables with intended start and finish dates of which the scheduling of employees may be an element10 A production process schedule is used for the planning of the production or the operation while a resource schedule aids in the logistical planning for sharing resources among several entitiesIn such cases a schedule is obtained by estimating the duration of each task and noting any dependencies amongst those tasks2 Dependencies in turn are tasks that must be completed in order to make other tasks possible such as renting a truck before loading materials on the truck since nothing can be loaded until the truck is available for things to be loaded on2 Scheduling of projects therefore requires the identification of all of the tasks necessary to complete the project and the earliest time at which each task can be completed2 In creating a schedule a certain amount of time is usually set aside as a contingency against unforeseen days This time is called scheduling variance11 or float12 and is a core concept for the critical path methodIn computingeditScheduling is important as an internal process in computer science wherein a schedule is a list of actions from a set of transactions in databases and scheduling is the way various processes are assigned in computer multitasking and multiprocessing operating system design This kind of scheduling is incorporated into the computer program and the user may be completely unaware of what tasks are being carried out and when Scheduling operations and issues in computing may includeThe operation of a network scheduler or packet scheduler an arbiter program that manages the movement of certain pieces of information in the computerOpen-shop scheduling Job Shop Scheduling Flow Shop Scheduling Problem optimization problems in computer scienceIO scheduling the order in which IO requests are submitted to a block device in operating systemsJob scheduler an enterprise software application in charge of unattended background executionsIn wireless communicationseditWireless networks should have a flexible service architecture to integrate different types of services on a single air-interface because terminals have different service requirements On top of the flexible service architecture effective Quality of Service QoS management schemes are also needed Therefore wireless resources need to be shared among all terminals carefully and it is desirable to schedule the usage of wireless resources as efficiently as possible while maximizing the overall network performance13In operations researcheditThe scheduling of resources usually subject to constraints is the subject of several problems that are in the area of research known as operations research usually in terms of finding an optimal solution or method for solvingFor example the nurse scheduling problem is concerned with scheduling a number of employees with typical constraints such as rotation of shifts limits on overtime etc The travelling salesman problem is concerned with scheduling a series of journeys to minimize time or distance Some of these problems may be solved efficiently with linear programming but many scheduling problems require integer variables Although efficient algorithms exist to give integer solutions in some situations see network flow models most problems that require integer solutions cannot yet be solved efficientlyIn transportation planningeditScheduling is useful in transportation planning The important components of transportation improvement proposals include a comprehensive evaluations of the scope of work to be completed b reasonably accurate cost estimates for finishing the task and c a feasible project schedule If any of these factors are not accurately defined then there is a strong possibility of unexpected difficulties Poor scoping andor scheduling may result in serious budget problems delays and cancellations of transportation improvements and sometimes even a domino effect that can negatively impact the entire areas transportation planning14In educationeditIn an educational institution a timetable must be established that refers students and teachers to classrooms each hour The challenge of constructing this schedule for larger institutions was addressed by Gunther Schmidt and Thomas Strhlein in 197615 They formalized the timetable construction problem and indicated an iterative process using logical matrices and hypergraphs to obtain a solutionSee alsoeditLook up scheduleor scheduling in Wiktionary the free dictionaryWikisource has the text
