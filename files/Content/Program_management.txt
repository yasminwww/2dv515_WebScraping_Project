in its aims program management is often closely related to systems engineering industrial engineering change management and business transformation In the defense sector it is the dominant approach to managing very large projects Because major defense programs entail working with contractors it is often called acquisition management indicating that the government buyer acquires goods and services by means of contractors The program manager has oversight of the purpose and status of the projects in a program and can use this oversight to support project-level activity to ensure the program goals are met by providing a decision-making capacity that cannot be achieved at project level or by providing the project manager with a program perspective when required or as a sounding board for ideas and approaches to solving project issues that have program impacts The program manager may be well placed to provide this insight by actively seeking out such information from the project managers although in large andor complex projects a specific role may be required However this insight arises the program manager needs this in order to be comfortable that the overall program goals are achievableContents1 Overview and definition2 Key factors3 Comparison with project management4 See also5 References6 Further reading7 External linksOverview and definitioneditThis section needs

organisations strategy or business transformation Program management also emphasizes the coordinating and prioritizing of resources across projects managing links between the projects and the overall costs and risks of the programAccording to one source a Program is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits and control NOT available from managing them individually  Programs may include elements of related work outside of the scope of the discrete projects in the program  Some projects within a program can deliver useful incremental benefits to the organization before the program itself has completed1Program management may provide a layer above the management of projects and focuses on selecting the best group of projects defining them in terms of their objectives and providing an environment where projects can be run successfully Program managers should not micromanage but should leave project management to the project managers  However program management might need to deal with interdependencies conflicts and resource or knowledge sharing among the projects it managesIn public sector work in  Europe the term normally refers to multiple change projects projects that are designed to deliver benefits to the host organization For example the Office of Government Commerce for the UK government An alternative to the Office of Government Commerces methodology for program management is that of the private sector Project Management InstituteMany organizations only run one program at a time a program containing all their projects In Project Management Institute terminology this is more likely to be a project portfolio than a program   Some larger organizations may have multiple programs each designed to deliver a range of improvements Some organizations use the concept of Systems Engineering where others use program managementKey factorseditGovernanceThe structure process and procedure to control operations and changes to performance objectives Governance must include a set of metrics to indicate the health and progress of the program in the most vital areasAlignmentThe program must support a higher

control2ImprovementContinuously assess performance research and develop new capabilities and systemically apply learning and knowledge to the programComparison with project managementeditThere are the two different views of how programs differ from projects In one view projects deliver outputs discrete parcels or chunks of change3 programs create outcomes4 In this view a project might deliver a new factory hospital or IT system By combining these projects with other deliverables and changes their programs might deliver increased income from a new product shorter waiting lists at the hospital or reduced operating costs due to improved technology The other view5 is that a program is nothing more than either a large project or a set or portfolio of projects In this second view the point of having a program is to exploit economies of scale and to reduce coordination costs and risks The project managers job is to ensure that their project succeeds The program manager on the other hand is concerned with the aggregate outcomes or end-state results of the collection of projects in a particular program For example in a financial institution a program may include one project that is designed to take advantage of a rising market and another that is designed to protect against the downside of a falling market The former seeks to leverage the potential upside the latter to limit the possible downside Consider a simple analogy Fix-A-Flat  This highly pressurized aerosol product injects a leak sealant into a punctured tire to stop the outflow of air project A and concurrently re-inflates the tire project B resulting together in the outcome that is a tire that is once again functional the program comprised projects A and B6According to the view that programs deliver outcomes but projects deliver outputs program management is concerned with doing the right projects The program manager has been described as playing chess and keeping the overview in mind with the pieces to be used or sacrificed being the projects7  In contrast project management is about doing projects right And also according to this view successful projects deliver on time to budget and to specification whereas successful programs deliver long term improvements to an organization Improvements are usually identified through benefits An organization should select the group of programs that most take it towards its strategic aims while remaining within its capacity to deliver the changes On the other hand the view that programs are simply large projects or a set of projects allows that a program may need to deliver tangible benefits quicklyAccording to one source the key difference between a program and a project is the finite nature of a project8 - a project must always have a specific end date else it is an ongoing programOne view of the differences between a program and a project in business is thatA project is unique and is of definite duration A program is ongoing and implemented within a business to consistently achieve certain results for the businessA project is designed to deliver an output or deliverable and its success will be in terms of delivering the right output at the right time and to the right costProgram management includes management of projects which together improve the performance of the organization A programs success will be measured in terms of benefitsBenefits are the measures of improvement of an organization and might include increased income increased profits decreased costs improved market position ability to compete reduced wastage or environmental damage more satisfied customers In central or local government organizations benefits might include providing a better service to the communityIn the course of achieving required results business programs will normally understand related business constraints and determine the processes required to achieve results based on resources allocated  Improvement of processes is a continuous operation that very much contrasts a program from a projectAt the lowest level project managers co-ordinate individual projects They are overseen by the program manager who accounts to the program sponsor or boardThere will normally be a process to change the predetermined scope of a project Programs often have to react to changes in strategy and changes in the environment in which the organization changesAnother view and another successful way of managing does not see any of the factors listed above as distinguishing projects from programs but rather sees the program as being about portfolio management On this view program management is about selecting projects adjusting the speed at which they run and adjusting their scope in order to the maximize the value of the portfolio as a whole and as economic or other external conditions change Still some emphasize that whereas a portfolio consists of independent projects a program is a collection of interdependent projects adding a dimension of complexity to the management taskYet another view is that a program management is nothing more than a large complex project where the integration aspect of project management is more important than in smaller projects Integration management is a key feature of the Project Management Institutes approach to project management Yet again some accept there is a distinction related to interdependencies between the elements of a project and a program In this view a program is a comparably loosely coupled system whereas large complex projects are tightly coupled This difference makes the project program a more ambiguous task to manage with more uncertainty reflecting a higher degree of freedom and a management task more open to exploit opportunities as they arise or the program management becomes aware of themIn practice it is not clear that there is a clear-cut distinction Projects or programs vary from small and simple to large and complex what needs to be a managed as a program in one culture or organization may be managed as a project in anotherSee alsoeditCost overrunList of project management topicsProject Management InstituteSystems engineeringComparison of
