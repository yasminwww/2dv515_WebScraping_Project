synthesizerA synthesizer or synthesiser1 is an electronic musical instrument that generates audio signals Synthesizers generate audio through methods including subtractive synthesis additive synthesis and frequency modulation synthesis These sounds may be shaped and modulated by components such as filters envelopes and low-frequency oscillators Synthesizers are typically sequenced controlled by software or instruments via MIDI or played with keyboards or other controllersSynthesizer-like instruments emerged in the USA in the mid-20th century with instruments such as the RCA Mark II a room-filling machine controlled with punch cards and composed of hundreds of vacuum tubes The Moog synthesizer developed by Robert Moog and first sold in 1964 is credited for pioneering analog synthesis concepts such as the voltage-controlled oscillator envelopes noise generators filters and sequencers In 1970 the cheaper smaller Minimoog standardized synthesizers as self-contained instruments with built-in keyboards compared to the larger modular synthesizers before it The first mass-produced synthesizer the Yamaha DX7 was launched in 1983 popularizing digital synthesis

Bibliography8 Further reading9 External linksHistoryeditPrecursorseditAs electricity became more widely available the early 20th century saw the invention of electronic musical instruments including the Telharmonium Trautonium Ondes Martenot and theremin3 The Hammond organ introduced in 1935 was the first electronic instrument to enjoy wide success3 In 1948 the Canadian engineer Hugh Le Caine completed the electronic sackbut a precursor to voltage-controlled synthesizers with keyboard sensitivity allowing for vibrato glissando and attack control3In 1957 Harry Olson and Herbert Belar completed the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer at the RCA laboratories in Princeton New Jersey The instrument read punched paper tape that controlled an analog synthesizer containing 750 vacuum tubes It was acquired by the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center and used almost exclusively by Milton Babbitt a composer at Princeton University3  Robert Moog with a Moog modular synthesizer Many of Moogs inventions such as voltage-controlled oscillators became standards of synthesizers1960s  1970s Early yearseditThe authors of Analog Days define the early years of the synthesizer as between 1964 and the mid-1970s beginning with the debut of the Moog synthesizer47 Designed by American engineer Robert Moog the synthesizer was composed of separate modules which created and shaped sounds connected by patch cords5 Whereas previous instruments had created sound from hundreds of vacuum tubes Moog developed a means of controlling pitch through voltage the voltage-controlled oscillator6 This along with Moog components such as envelopes noise generators filters and sequencers became standards in the synthesizer market74Around the same period American engineer Don Buchla created the Buchla Modular Electronic Music System8 Instead of a conventional keyboard Buchlas system used touchplates which transmitted control voltages depending on finger position and force4 However the Moogs keyboard made it more accessible and marketable to musicians and keyboards became the standard means of controlling synthesizers4 Moog and Buchla initially avoided the word synthesizer for their instruments as it was associated with the RCA synthesizer Moog used the word in print for the first time in 1966 By the 1970s synthesizer had become the standard term4  The Minimoog introduced in 1970 was the first synthesizer sold in music storesIn 1970 Moog launched a cheaper smaller synthesizer the Minimoog910 The Minimoog was the first synthesizer sold in music stores4 and was more practical for live performance it standardized the concept of synthesizers as self-contained instruments with built-in keyboards1112 After retail stores started selling synthesizers in 1971 other synthesizer companies were established including ARP in the US and EMS in the UK4 ARPs products included the ARP 2600 which folded into a carrying case and had built-in speakers and the Odyssey a rival to the Minimoog4 The less expensive EMS synthesizers were used by European art rock and progressive rock acts including Brian Eno and Pink Floyd4 Designs for synthesizers appeared in the amateur electronics market such as the Practical Electronics Sound Synthesiser published in Practical Electronics in 19731 By the mid-1970s ARP was the worlds largest synthesizer manufacturer4Early synthesizers were monophonic meaning they could only play one note at a time Some of the earliest commercial polyphonic synthesizers were created by American engineer Tom Oberheim8 such as the OB-X 19794 In 1978 the American company Sequential Circuits released the Prophet-5 first fully programmable polyphonic synthesizer793 The Prophet-5 used microprocessors for patch memory allowing users to store sounds13 This overcame a major difficulty in previous synthesizers which required users to adjust cables and knobs to change sounds with no guarantee of exactly recreating a sound4 This facilitated a move from synthesizers creating unpredictable sounds to producing a standard package of familiar sounds43851980s Market growth and digital technologyeditThe synthesizer market grew dramatically in the 1980s757 1982 saw the introduction of MIDI a standardized means of synchronizing synthesizers and other electronic instruments it remains an industry standard14 An influential sampling synthesizer the Fairlight CMI was released in 197913 with the ability to record and play back samples prerecorded sounds at different pitches15 Though its high price made it inaccessible to amateurs it was adopted by high-profile pop musicians including Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel The success of the Fairlight drove competition improving sampling technology and lowering prices15 early competing samplers included the E-mu Emulator in 198115 and the Akai S-series in 198516  The Yamaha DX7 released in 1983 was the first commercially successful digital synthesizer and was widely used in 1980s pop musicIn 1983 Yamaha released the first commercially successful digital synthesizer the Yamaha DX717 Based on frequency modulation synthesis developed by Stanford University engineer John Chowning18 the DX7 remains one of the bestselling synthesizers in history1719 and was the first synthesizer to earn six-digit sales figures757 It was widely used in 1980s pop music20 Compared to the warm and fuzzy sounds of analog synthesis the DX7 was characterized by its harsh glassy and chilly sounds2 Digital synthesizers typically contained preset sounds emulating acoustic instruments with algorithms controlled with menus and buttons4The success of the DX7 led to competing digital synthesizers from companies including Roland which released the D-50 in 1987 to success The D-50 blended Rolands linear arithmetic algorithm with samples and was the first mass-produced synthesizer with built-in effects such as delay reverb and chorus763 In 1988 the Japanese manufacturer Korg released the M1 a digital synthesizer workstation featuring featuring sampled transients and loops and built-in effects21 With over 250000 units sold it remains the bestselling synthesizer in history21 The advent of digital synthesizers led to a downturn in interest in analog synthesizers7591990s  present Software synthesizers and analog revivaledit1997 saw the release of ReBirth by Propellerhead Software and Reality by Seer Systems the first software synthesizers that could be played in real time via MIDI7 In 1999 an update to the music software Cubase allowed users to run software instruments including synthesizers as plug-ins triggering a torrent of new software instruments22 Propellerheads Reason released in 2000 offered users a virtual rack of recognisable studio equipment22 According to Sound on Sound in 2014 computer emulations of analog synth architecture are frequently indiscernible from the real thing23 Whereas once they had filled rooms synthesizers now can be embedded on single microchips in any electronic device4The market for patchable and modular synthesizers rebounded in the late 1990s732 In the 2000s older analog synthesizers regained popularity with old equipment sometimes selling for much more than its original price23 In the 2010s new affordable analog synthesizers were introduced by companies including Moog Korg Arturia and Dave Smith Instruments The renewed interest is credited to the appeal of imperfect organic sounds and simpler interfaces and to modern surface-mount technology making analog synthesizers cheaper and faster to manufacture23Impactedit  Keyboardist Keith Emerson performing with a Moog synthesizer in 1970When synthesizers emerged in the 1960s they were viewed as avant-garde valued by the 1960s psychedelic and counter-cultural scenes for their ability to make new sounds but with little perceived commercial potential Switched-On Bach 1968 an bestselling album of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer by Wendy Carlos demonstrated that synthesizers could be more than random noise machines5 taking them to the mainstream4 Debates were held about the appropriateness of synthesizers in baroque music and according to the Guardian they were quickly abandoned in serious classical circles24The Moog was adopted by acts including the Doors the Grateful Dead the Rolling Stones the Beatles and Keith Emerson25 Emerson was the first major rock musician to perform with the Moog and it became a trademark of his performances helping take his band Emerson Lake  Palmer to global stardom according to Analog Days the likes of Emerson with his Moog performances did for the keyboard what Jimi Hendrix did for the guitar4200The portable Minimoog 1970 much smaller than the modular synthesizers before it made synthesizers more common in live performance12 The Minimoog took a place in mainstream black music most notably in the work of Stevie Wonder4 and in jazz such as the work of Sun Ra26 It was also used by electronic artists such as Kraftwerk who used it on their albums Autobahn 1974 and The Man-Machine 1978 and later by Tangerine Dream Klaus Schulze and Gary Numan26 In the late 1970s and the early 1980s it was widely used in the emerging disco genre by artists including Abba and Giorgio Moroder26 Some acts felt that using synthesizers to create sounds was musical cheating Queen wrote on its album covers that they did not use them27Early synthesizers could only play one note at a time making them suitable for basslines leads and solos26 With the rise of polyphonic synthesizers in the 70s and 80s the keyboard in rock once more started to revert to the background to be used for fills and atmosphere rather than for soloing4207 Sampling introduced with the Fairlight synthesizer in 1979 has influenced all genres of music6 and had a major influence on the development of electronic and hip hop music2829In the 1970s electronic music composers such as Jean Michel Jarre30 and Isao Tomita313233 released successful synthesizer-led instrumental albums This helped influence the emergence of synthpop a subgenre of new wave from the late 1970s to the early 1980s The work of German krautrock bands such as Kraftwerk34 and Tangerine Dream British acts such as John Foxx Gary Numan and David Bowie African-American acts such as George Clinton and Zapp and Japanese electronic acts such as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Kitaro were influential in the development of the genre35 Gary Numans 1979 hits Are Friends Electric and Cars made heavy use of synthesizers3637 OMDs Enola Gay 1980 used distinctive electronic percussion and a synthesized melody Soft Cell used a synthesized melody on their 1981 hit Tainted Love35 Nick Rhodes keyboardist of Duran Duran used various synthesizers including the Roland Jupiter-4 and Jupiter-838 Chart hits include Depeche Modes Just Cant Get Enough 198135 the Human Leagues Dont You Want Me39 and works by Ultravox35In the 1980s digital synthesizers were widely used in pop music20 The Yamaha DX7 released in 1983 became a pop staple used on songs by A-ha Kenny Loggins Kool  the Gang2 Its E PIANO 1 preset became particularly famous2 especially for power ballads40 and was used by artists including Whitney Houston Chicago40 Prince20 Phil Collins Luther Vandross Billy Ocean2 and Celine Dion41 The Roland TB-303 1981 in conjunction with the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines became a foundation of electronic dance music genres such as house and techno when producers acquired cheap second-hand units later in the decade42 Korg M1 presets were widely used in 1990s house music beginning with Madonnas 1990 single Vogue43Today the synthesizer is used in every genre of music47 It is considered by the authors of Analog Days the only innovation that can stand alongside the electric guitar as a great new instrument of the age of electricity  Both led to new forms of music and both had massive popular appeal47 The authors draw a connection to the synthesizers origins in 1960s psychedelia to the raves and British second summer of love of the 1980s and the club scenes of the 1990s and 2000s4321 According to Fact in 2016 The synthesizer is as important and as ubiquitous in modern music today as the human voice2 It is one of the most important instruments in the music industry35Film and televisioneditThis section needs expansion You can help by adding to it  November 2019Synthesizers are common in film and television soundtracks4273 ARP synthesizers for example were used to create sound effects for the 1977 science fiction films Close Encounters of the Third Kind49 and Star Wars including the voice of the robot R2-D24273 In the 70s and 80s synthesizers were used in the scores for thrillers and horror films including A Clockwork Orange 1971 Apocalypse Now 1979 The Fog 1980 and Manhunter 198644 They were also used to create themes for television shows including Knight Rider 1982 Twin Peaks 1990 and Stranger Things 201644JobseditThe rise of the synthesizer led to major changes in music industry jobs comparable to the earlier arrival of sound in film which put live musicians accompanying silent films out of work45 With its ability to imitate instruments such as strings and horns the synthesizer threatened the jobs of session musicians For a period the Moog was banned from use in commercial work a restriction negotiated by the American Federation of Musicians AFM4 Robert Moog felt that the AFM had not realized that his instrument had to be studied like any other and instead imagined that all the sounds that musicians could make somehow existed in the Moog  all you had to do was push a button that said Jascha Heifetz and out would come the most fantastic violin player46Musician Walter Sear persuaded the AFM that the synthesizer demanded skill and the category of synthesizer player was accepted into the union however players were still subject to suspicion and hostility for several years4149 In 1982 following a tour by Barry Manilow using synthesizers instead of an orchestra the British Musicians Union attempted to ban synthesizers attracting controversy47 That decade a few musicians skilled at programming the popular Yamaha DX7 found employment creating sounds for other acts48Sound synthesiseditThis section needs additional citations for verification Please help improve

1900s and Hammond organ in 1930s  Subtractive synthesis is still utilized on various synths including virtual analog synthSubtractive synthesis uses oscillators to generate waveforms then shapes them with filters to remove or boost specific frequencies7  FM synthesis was hugely successful in the earliest digital synthesizersFrequency modulation FM synthesis creates sounds by modulating one waveform with the frequency of another the resulting complex waveform can in turn be used to modulate another and this another and so on FM synthesis can imitate acoustic sounds such as piano strings and organs49Phase distortion synthesis is a method implemented on Casio CZ synthesizers It replaces the traditional analog waveform with a choice of several digital waveforms which are more complex than the standard square sine and sawtooth waves This waveform is routed to a digital filter and digital amplifier each modulated by an eight-stage envelope The sound can then be further modified with ring modulation or noise modulation50  Physical modelling synthesis is often implemented as software synthesizersPhysical modelling synthesis is the synthesis of sound by using a set of equations and algorithms to simulate each sonic characteristic of an instrument starting with the harmonics that make up the tone itself then adding the sound of the resonator the instrument body etc until the sound realistically approximates the desired instrument When an initial set of parameters is run through the physical simulation the simulated sound is generated Although physical modeling was not a new concept in acoustics and synthesis it was not until the development of the Karplus-Strong algorithm and the increase in DSP power in the late 1980s that commercial implementations became feasible The quality and speed of physical modeling on computers improves with higher processing powercitation needed  Analysisresynthesis is typically used on the vocoderLinear arithmetic synthesis is a form of synthesis that utilizes PCM samples for the attack of a waveform and subtractive synthesis for the rest of the envelope This type of synthesis bridges the gap between the older subtractive synthesis and the newer sample-based synthesis at a time where PCM samples would take up a substantial amount of the memory allotted The first synthesizer to debut with this form of synthesis was the Roland D-50 in 1987citation neededSample-based synthesis involves digitally recording a short snippet of sound from a real instrument or other source and then playing it back at different speeds to produce different pitches A sample can be played as a one shot used often for percussion or short duration sounds or it can be looped which allows the tone to sustain or repeat as long as the note is held Samplers usually include a filter envelope generators and other controls for further manipulation of the sound Virtual samplers that store the samples on a hard drive make it possible for the sounds of an entire orchestra including multiple articulations of each instrument to be accessed from a sample library See also Wavetable synthesis Vector synthesiscitation neededAnalysisresynthesis is a form of synthesis that uses a series of bandpass filters or Fourier transforms to analyze the harmonic content of a sound The results are then used to resynthesize the sound using a band of oscillators The vocoder linear predictive coding and some forms of speech synthesis are based on analysisresynthesiscitation neededComponentseditThis section needs additional citations for

modern synthesizers use a combination of DSP software and hardware or else are purely software-based see softsynth  Digital synthesizers often emulate classic analog designs  Sound is controllable by the operator by means of circuits or virtual stages that may includeOscillators typically produce waveforms such as sawtooth sine or pulse waves with different timbres7Low-frequency oscillators LFOs produce waveforms used to modulate parameters such as the pitch of oscillators producing vibrato7Voltage-controlled filter VCFs  shape the sound generated by the oscillators in the frequency domain often under the control of an envelope or LFO  These are essential to subtractive synthesisEnvelope generators  provide envelope modulation to shape the volume or harmonic content of the produced note in the time domain with the principal parameters being attack decay sustain and release  These are used in most forms of synthesis  ADSR control is provided by envelope generatorsVoltage-controlled amplifiers VCAs control the volume or gain of the audio signal VCAs can be modulated by other components such as LFOs and envelopes7After the signal generated by one or a mix of more VCOs has been modified by filters and LFOs and its waveform has been shaped contoured by an ADSR envelope generator it then passes on to one or more voltage-controlled amplifiers VCAs A VCA is a preamp that boosts amplifies the electronic signal before passing it on to an external or built-in power amplifier as well as a means to control its amplitude volume using an attenuator The gain of the VCA is affected by a control voltage CV coming from an envelope generator an LFO the keyboard or some other source51FiltereditVarious  filter modesMain article Voltage controlled filterElectronic filters are particularly important in subtractive synthesis being designed to pass some frequency regions or bands through unattenuated while significantly attenuating subtracting others  The low-pass filter is most frequently used but band-pass filters band-reject filters and high-pass filters are also sometimes availableThe filter may be controlled with a second ADSR envelope  An envelope modulation env mod parameter on many synthesizers with filter envelopes determines how much the envelope affects the filter  If turned all the way down the filter produces a flat sound with no envelope  When turned up the envelope becomes more noticeable expanding the minimum and maximum range of the filter The envelope applied on the filter helps the sound designer generating long notes or short notes by moving the parameters up and down such as decay sustain and finally release For instance by using a short decay with no sustain the sound generated is commonly known as a stab Sound designers may prefer shaping the sound with filter instead of volumeEnvelopeeditMain article Envelope music  Schematic of ADSREnvelopes control how sounds change over time They may control parameters such as amplitude volume filters frequencies or pitch The most common envelope is the ADSR attack decay sustain release envelope7Attack time is the time taken for initial run-up of level from nil to peak beginning when the note is triggeredDecay time is the time taken for the subsequent run down from the attack level to the designated sustain levelSustain level is the level during the main sequence of the sounds duration until the key is releasedRelease time is the time taken for the level to decay from the sustain level to zero after the key is releasedLFOeditLFO section of Access Virus CMain article Low-frequency oscillationA low-frequency oscillator LFO generates an electronic signal usually below 20Hz  LFO signals create a periodic control signal or sweep often used in vibrato tremolo and other effects  In certain genres of electronic music the LFO signal can control the cutoff frequency of a VCF to make a rhythmic wah-wah sound or the signature dubstep wobble bassArpeggiatoreditSee also Home organ and Music sequencerAn arpeggiator arp is a feature available on several synthesizers that automatically steps through a sequence of notes based on an input chord thus creating an arpeggio  The notes can often be transmitted to a MIDI sequencer for recording and further editing  An arpeggiator may have controls for speed range and order in which the notes play upwards downwards or in a random order  More advanced arpeggiators allow the user to step through a pre-programmed complex sequence of notes or play several arpeggios at once  Some allow a pattern sustained after releasing keys in this way a sequence of arpeggio patterns may be built up over time by pressing several keys one after the other Arpeggiators are also commonly found in software sequencers  Some arpeggiatorssequencers expand features into a full phrase sequencer which allows the user to trigger complex multi-track blocks of sequenced data from a keyboard or input device typically synchronized with the tempo of the master clockAn arpeggiator interface on Novation NovaTrance Leadsound sample of arpeggiatorA sample of Eurodance synthesizer riff with use of rapid 116 notes

instruments through the late 1970s and early 1980s  Notable examples are the RMI Harmonic Synthesizer 197453 Roland Jupiter-8 Oberheim OB-8 Roland SH-101 Sequential Circuits Six-Trak and Korg Polysix  A famous example can be heard on Duran Durans song Rio in which the arpeggiator on a Roland Jupiter-4 plays a C minor chord in random mode They fell out of favor by the latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s and were absent from the most popular synthesizers of the period but a resurgence of interest in analog synthesizers during the 1990s and the use of rapid-fire arpeggios in several popular dance hits brought with it a resurgenceControllerseditSynthesizers are often controlled with keyboards which may be built into the synthesizer unit or attached via connections such as CVgate USB or
