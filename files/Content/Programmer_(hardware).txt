Programmer hardware - WikipediaProgrammer hardwareFrom Wikipedia the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to search  Pocket Programmer Galep-5 with a ZIF socket  SuperPro6100 USB interfaced stand alone Universal Programmerwith plug-in Adapter Board  The 3928 with up to seven sites is made for programming large data devices such as MCUs eMMC HS400 NAND NOR and Serial Flash devices High-speed signals support devices up to 200 Mhz and the latest eMMC HS400 modes with data transfer rates of 25 nanoseconds per byteA programmer hardware device programmer chip programmer device burner1364 or PROM writer2 is a piece of electronic equipment that arrange written software to configure programmable non-volatile integrated circuits called programmable devices33 The target devices include PROM EPROM EEPROM Flash memory eMMC MRAM FeRAM NVRAM PLD PLA PAL GAL CPLD FPGA and MCU These are terminologies in the field of computer hardwareContents1 Function2 Types3 History4 Manufactures5 See also6 References7 External linksFunctionedit  JTAG Connector-basedOn-Board Programmerfor AVR microcontrollerwith USB Port interfaceProgrammer hardware has two variants One is configuring the target device itself with a socket on the programmer Another is configuring the device on a printed circuit boardIn the former case the target device is inserted into a socket usually ZIF on top of the programmer4642 pdf15 If the device is not a standard DIP packaging a plug-in adapter board which converts the footprint with another socket is used558In the latter case device programmer is directly connected to the printed circuit board by a connector usually with a cable This way is called on-board programming in-circuit programming or in-system programming678Afterwards the data is transferred from the programmer into the device by applying signals through the connecting pins Some devices have a serial interface9232 pdf3for receiving the programming data including JTAG interface4642 pdf15Other devices require the data on parallel pins followed by a programming pulse with a higher voltage for programming the data into the device10125Usually device programmers are connected to a personal computer through a parallel port1364USB port11or LAN interface12A software program on the computer then transfers the data to the programmer136413430selects the device and interface type and starts the programming process to read write erase blank the data inside the device1415Typesedit  A Gang Programmer with a Set of 4 Sockets  Xertek SuperBot-216-Sockets Automated Gang ProgrammerThere are four general types of device programmersAutomated programmers multi-programming sites having a set of sockets16 for mass production4 These systems utilize robotic pick and place handlers with on-board sites This allows for high volume and complex output such as laser marking 3D inspection Tape inputoutput etcDevelopment programmers usually single-programming site for first article development and small-series production17Pocket programmers for development and field service1718Specialized programmers for certain circuit types only such as FPGA19 microcontroller4642 pdf15 and EEPROM programmers14Historyedit  Historical ProgrammerA shoebox size  Pocket-sized  USB Port interfaced ICE  for MCU Flash memory ProgrammerRegarding old PROM programmers as the many programmable devices have different voltage requirements every pin driver must be able to apply different voltages in a range of 025 Volts206512140But according to the progress of memory device technology recent flash memory programmers do not need high voltages2223In the early days of computing booting mechanism was a mechanical devices usually consisted of switches and LEDs It means the programmer was not an equipment but a human who entered machine codes one by one by setting the switches in a series of on and off positions These positions of switches corresponded to the machine codes similar to todays assembly language242612622526Nowadays EEPROMs are used for bootstrapping mechanism as BIOS and no need to operate mechanical switches for programming2745ManufactureseditFor each vendors web
